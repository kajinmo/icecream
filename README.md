## about the dataset
The database used was found on the Kaggle platform, which contains details and estimates of 241 flavors from four ice cream brands: Ben&Jerry's, Breyers, HÃ¤agen-Dazs and Talenti.

## The files used:
- 'products.csv': which contains descriptive information about each ice cream flavor: flavor name, description, average rating, and ingredient list.
- 'reviews.csv': which contains all the reviews used to calculate the average score of the previous dataset


## project planning
Part 1: exploratory data analysis

Part 2: data processing and cleaning

Part 3: hypothesis testing and modeling with linear regression (coming soon)

Part 4: modeling with multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) (coming soon)
