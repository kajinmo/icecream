BenJerrys,1,Tiniest amount of cookie dough of all time,"I love Ben & Jerry’s which is why I am writing this review - I feel they would care to know how disappointing this flavor is! The core in the pint I purchased was super small, making it a total disappointment. I kept digging hoping it would get bigger and it just ended up almost disappearing. The ice cream as always was delicious, but I felt I would’ve been more satisfied with my old favorite standby, half baked."
BenJerrys,1,Is this a joke?,I was so excited for this because I love cookie dough but there’s never enough. I thought the core would look how it’s advertised. Spoiler alert: It didn’t. Barely any dough. Didn’t go all the way through consistently and couldn’t even be in the center. Also the dough didn’t taste great? Idk why but I like the vanilla better. Should have read the reviews first it was such a let down and I feel like I wasted my money.
BenJerrys,1,wish it was better,"Even after reading all the reviews that said it wasn't good I still went and bought it anyways because it looked & sounded so good, but sadly the reviews are right. most of the time with cookie dough ice cream I wish there was more cookie dough (i thought this would be the super cookie-doughy flavor i always dreamed of.. theres not even that much in it), but with this pint i actually prefer the part around the core that doesn't have any. ben & jerry if u see this please re-make this flavor with better quality cookie dough, it had so much potential"
BenJerrys,1,Heartbreaker,"I preordered this as soon as they announced that it was available in the online store. I was so excited to dig in but while the ice cream is delicious, the cookie dough core is terrible. Rock hard, gritty, sandy, and very inconsistent in size from the top of the pint to the bottom. I hate having to write this review, especially because the other 2 new cookie cores were pretty good, but this one is REALLY dreadful! I’m really bummed because I wanted badly to love it."
BenJerrys,1,Disappointed,"I waited and waited for this to be available at my local store. Yuck. Hard, grainy cookie dough core? This is nothing like cookie dough. Don’t be fooled, the cookie dough core is SMALL! I’m a Ben and Jerry’s fan, but you lost me here. So disappointed!"
BenJerrys,1,Let down,"Such a let down from Ben and Jerry’s. The cookie dough core was hard, dry, and basically tasted like granulated sugar. I am so underwhelmed by all the cores but this one was by far the most disappointing. Stick to the regular pints: my opinion best flavor is Gimme S’more."
BenJerrys,1,Tasted like sweet sand.,Bought this last night and was incredibly disappointed. Never write reviews but don’t buy this. The cookie dough was literally like sweet sand. It was gritty and grainy. Threw us away after about 5 bites. I’ll stick to the original Cookie Dough.
BenJerrys,1,The core was a disappointment!,"I bought this, excited to try it as cookie dough is my favorite. Well the core was rock solid. It had to be eaten in 1 huge chunk instead of mixing with the ice cream. Very disappointed!"
BenJerrys,1,An overhyped disappointment,"I will not buy this again. It's good ice cream, but the ""core"" is a joke. People buy cookie dough ice cream for , surprise... the cookie dough. This ""core"" tastes like grainy sugar and shortening and not like cookie dough at all. And there's less than ever. The company found a way to give customers less if what they want with the hopes that all the hype about ""new and improved"" sways people. Well, I'm not fooled and I believe most others won't be either. It's overpriced and a big disappointment. I repeat, I will not buy again."
BenJerrys,1,Simply AWFUL - Who signed off on this?,"The idea sounded so amazing, so I did not think it could possibly be as bad as the reviews said it was...Well I was wrong, it is actually worse. The ice cream itself is fine, but the core tastes like just brown sugar crystals. Not even remotely the same flavor or texture as their normal cookie dough. Did someone actually taste this before signing off on it? This is a total miss and anyone who was fooled into buying it should be provided a refund."
BenJerrys,1,Huge disappointment,This is not the same flavor as the well known Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.
BenJerrys,1,Not much cookie dough,"I bought this at target because they didn’t have the original cookie dough I liked. It’s not good y’all. The dough seems like a new recipe. It’s got an odd texture, like sugar grains didn’t mix well and the chocolate chips are weird. The worst part is there’s not enough weird dough compared to the vanilla ice cream. I hope the old cookie dough hasn’t been replaced with this!"
BenJerrys,1,"Great concept, horrible execution","I was really excited to see this in my grocer’s freezer. Having had karamel sutra core with its strong ratio of caramel to ice cream, I thought it would be great to get a nice glob of cookie dough going down the center of the pint. Instead, I was left incredibly disappointed with hardly any cookie dough in the entire container. Even worse, the dough included seemed to be dry and crumbly compared to what I’m used to in regular cookie dough. Very disappointing, I won’t be buying this one again unless they improve the formulation and increase the cookie dough. Worst b&j pint I’ve ever purchased."
BenJerrys,1,This is horrible,"The regular chocolate chip cookie dough is my favorite and has been for YEARS, its soooo BOMB!! This iteration of it is absolutely disgusting the cookie core is not dough its literally just sugar, and it doesnt even go throughout the entire pint, not even half, not even in the center , its the grossest thing .Some of the other cores are really good which is why i gave this one a try but how could you get chocolate chip cookie dough wrong . I dont normally write reviews but I felt like i HAD to warn someone."
BenJerrys,1,Could've been better.,"When I first heard this flavor was coming out I was so excited. I waited 4 weeks to get my hands on one of these and finally found one yesterday at Wawa. I read the reviews before purchasing this, but decided to give this the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, everyone was right. The cookie dough has a sandy texture and crumbles to pieces and it doesn't taste very good either. Plus the core didnt even go all the way to the bottom of the container...definately wasn't worth the $5.99 I paid for it. :("
BenJerrys,1,Extremely disappointed,Wow I love ben and jerrys but this one is sad. I debated between this one and another core one but chose this one due to my love of cookie dough. Well I wish I read the reviews first because they were incredibly right. Grainy cookie dough and the core in mine didn't even go half way down!!!
BenJerrys,1,Save your money for a better pint,I was soooooo excited to try this!! Then I did and immediately wished I got something else. The ice cream was good but the supposed cookie dough core was like eating brown sugar and chocolate chips. It was so nasty that I ate around it. Truly disappointed....I have never been let down before so I guess there is a first time for everything.
BenJerrys,1,Disappointing Core,"I've never gotten a cookie dough core pint from Ben and Jerry's, but I'll never buy this again. I was expecting it to look the way the caramel core does when you open it, but instead there is such little cookie dough it would've been better to just get a regular cookie dough or half baked pint. If I'm going to spend $5 for a pint, I would at least like to get what is advertised. The same happened with my boyfriend's brownie batter core so this is not just a one time thing, but a consistent problem."
BenJerrys,1,Disappointed,I have been waiting for this to come out at my grocery store. The minute I could buy it I got it. I was really upset. Like many others have said the cookie dough core is sandy and grainy. I was thinking it was going to be like the cookie dough in the normal ice cream. Really upset about this.
BenJerrys,1,Grainy and barely there.,I am a loyal fan and this is the one and only flavor I have thrown away. The pictures make it look amazing and I understand it’s for marketing so variation is expected. That being said the “core” is almost non existent. The bottom half of the ice cream had absolutely no core. The top half had a small chunk. The cookie dough that I did get was grainy and had a funky taste. It wasn’t cookie dough that’s for sure. The ice cream itself was creamy and had a nice flavor but I’m so disappointed that this was such a flop.
BenJerrys,1,Cookie dough is very grainy,Not at all like non core cookie dough which is soft and tastes really good. The core tastes terrible and has a very hard grainy texture. Not good!
BenJerrys,1,"Boring, almost disgusting flavor!","This is the first time I haven't been able to finish a pint of Ben & Jerry's. Tried it and threw the rest away! I love cookie dough ice cream and thought this would be great, only to be extremely disappointed! The vanilla ice cream is almost tasteless, and the cookie dough ""core"" was absolutely gross. It had none of the flavors I would expect from cookie dough, basically just sugar with a few chocolate chips. Plus, the core was half the size of the other flavors! This flavor is a HUGE miss, save yourself the trouble and try the sugar cookie core flavor instead!"
BenJerrys,1,Disappointed,"I wait and waited for this to be available at my local store. Yuck. HARD, grainy, gritty cookie dough core. This is nothing like cookie dough. Don't be fooled the cookie dough center is SMALL. I'm a Ben & Jerry's fan, but you lost me here. So disappointed in my purchase."
BenJerrys,1,"Love B&J, hate this flavor","I literally stalked the grocery stores for this to come out and was so excited to snag it. Super disappointed. I’m a huge fan of B&J and cookie dough ice cream but this was terrible. Agree with other reviewers, the cookie dough was grainy and gritty. I didn’t want to throw it out so I kept eating it, but it took me well over 2 weeks to finish a pint. For context, I’m lucky if a pint lasts three days."
BenJerrys,1,Core is Nasty,I bout the NEW COOKIE DOUGH CORE. Was not good at all when I think of cookie dough it’s soft creamy just like normal cookie dough. It’s like eating sand very big disappointment honestly and I ben&jerrys. Work on this please!
BenJerrys,1,Buy the regular cookie dough version!!,Bought this today and was so disappointed! Cookie dough is nothing like in the reg chocolate chip cookie dough. I thought at first maybe it was supposed to have some kind of swirl in it and never found the cookie dough core like you find with the brownie batter version! It’s awful esp if you thunk your getting the cookie dough like in the reg or the bites. I would give it one star but it won’t let me.
BenJerrys,1,DO NOT BUY,my brother picked this up on accident instead of the regular one. This was horrible. Absolutely the worst thing I’ve tasted in my life. Grainy dry sand as “dough”. Ice cream below par. Horrible choice all around. I’ll never get that 7$ back. ROBBERY!
BenJerrys,1,Should have trusted the bad reviews,Totally disappointed in this flavor. I love Ben & Jerry’s cookie dough. But the cookie dough core was terrible. First of all the core was more like a cone getting smaller the more you dug down and it didn’t go all the way down to the bottom of the pint. And the cookie dough itself was terrible it was grainy and didn’t have the same taste the cookies dough usually has. It tasted like it was heavy on brown sugar or something. It just wasn’t right. Anyway I was sorely disappointed.
BenJerrys,1,Disappointment,"Nope, Nope, Nope! You cannot fool a cookie dough expert. I had my heart set on this having a REAL cookie dough core. Much to my dismay, the core was nothing like the cookie dough in your other ice creams. :("
BenJerrys,1,Worst cookie dough EVER!!,"Now let me just say that chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream is my favorite B&J flavor. I bought this new flavor about a week ago thinking it would be great. How can you go wrong with a choc chip cookie dough core I thought. Boy was I wrong. I took one bite of that cookie dough core, and went ""Blech!"" The ice cream with chocolate bits was good. That was it. What recipe they used to make this cookie dough core is not even close to the taste or consistency of the classic original. The taste is vile. I would not waste your time buying this flavor."
BenJerrys,1,Cookie dough taste is disgusting,If you love the cookie dough from the regular ice cream don't buy this! I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a Ben and Jerry's flavor. The cookie dough they use for the core is completely different in the worse ways. It's mushy and taste like garbage. It's salty and weird tasting. I like lots of different kinds of cookie dough. I don't think I've ever tasted any kind of cookie dough that I've hated before. Until now. How did this pass taste testing? Good thing there was hardly any core anyway so I can still eat the ice cream part.
BenJerrys,1,Dissapointing,Like most other reviewers i found the core terrible. Bad texture and bad taste.
BenJerrys,1,Disappointed,"I bought this with so much excitement, when I took that first bite into the core, yuck! The cookie dough is just straight sugar, when you chew it your feel the grinds on your teeth. I love the chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and that is the cookie dough I expected the core to be filled with and boy was I wrong! Do not purchase this kind, you will just end up throwing it away like I did"
BenJerrys,1,That's not dough!,"I was really disappointed with the cookie dough in the core. It was dry and crumbly, not creamy and doughy like the regular CCCD. It also has an off flavor...like they spilled the vanilla when making this crusty old dough. The ice cream part was decent. I saw somebody else noted a big air bubble at the bottom. I'm had the same experience. I do not recommend and will not purchase again."
BenJerrys,1,Bad Mistake,"My family bought this on accident thinking it was the regular cookie dough recipe. I tried it anyways and it was way too sweet. The cookie milk was not a smart move, there was nothing to offset the sweetness of the cookie dough. Cookie dough with just vanilla is much better in my opinion. Also, the cookie dough was very grainy and mostly tasted like straight up sugar."
BenJerrys,1,Not enough cookie dough,"I loooove cookie dough ice cream. When I saw the core on the package I was like “heck yes! Extra cookie dough!” Psych! There’s like NONE and it’s impossible to scoop out. Then, the cookie dough itself is disgusting! It tastes like how I imagine literal fish food would. I absolutely hate it and I genuinely think it was a waste of my money."
BenJerrys,1,So disappointed,"I’m so sad I wasted $12 on this ice cream, I am in Australia and I was so excited to try this and i am so let down I didn’t even eat it. The cookie dough is grainy and tastes nothing like the cookie dough that’s in the rest of the flavours, and the “fudge” pieces are just dark chocolate. Do not waste your money!"
BenJerrys,1,The worst cookie dough!,One of my favorite flavors is the cookie dough. Expectations were highly disappointed when the same cookie dough recipe was not in this cookie dough core flavor. I’m not even sure it’s cookie dough. I think it’s pure brown sugar. Will not buy this flavor again unless they put the original cookie dough in it!
BenJerrys,1,Ehh,"Im eating this flavor as we speak and the other reviews are right! Tastes NOTHING like the cookie doigh in the other flavors. It has a sandy, gritty texture like chewing on sugar. Im going to finish it though because the rest of it is alright. But yeah i’ll just stick to my favorite one , Half Baked!!!"
BenJerrys,1,Extremely dissappointed! Don't waste your money!!,"I've bought this a few different times, each time hoping it would be better than the last. I kept thinking ""okay, I must have had bad luck and gotten a bad batch"". Unfortunately after buying approximately 5 to 6 pints, I've come to the conclusion that this just isn't good in any way. The ""cookie milk"" ice cream just tastes like regular old vanilla but with a slightly weird taste and extremely weird aftertaste. The ""cookie dough"" core (which, in my opinion, is supposed to be the best part and main attraction) was horrible! Did NOT taste like cookie dough AT ALL! Even the texture was so, soooooo off! Just like all the other reviews say - TASTES LIKE SWEETENED SAND! Now don't get my wrong - I am usually a HUGE fan of B&J's - however this particular flavor just is completely so far off from the quality I've come to know and love, and expect from this brand. This could have been an amazing and wonderful flavor but unfortunately this missed the mark. Extremely dissappointed, B&J's!! Do better!!"
BenJerrys,1,awful texture,"Was so excited to try this because I love Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. I experienced disappointment at the first bite. The Cookie Chip Dough Core was like eating super gritty sugar sand. I am hoping Ben & Jerry will switch and use their original Cookie Dough recipe in this new ""core"" ice cream."
BenJerrys,1,Stick to Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough,"The ratio of cookie dough to ice cream is off. By the time you get to the bottom of the pint, all that's left is the vanilla ice cream with little chocolate bits. You're better off getting chocolate chip cookie dough which is more consistent and has a better cookie dough-to-ice cream ratio."
BenJerrys,1,Cookie core is nasty,"I just had this ice cream a hour ago, the actually ice is not bad at all but the cookie dough just ruined it for me. It tasted so gritty , I thought maybe I should mix it up and it made it even worse. I ended up scooping as much of the cookie dough out that I could. Smh"
BenJerrys,1,Not what I expected,"Listen to the bad reviews. the core does not taste like their regular cookie dough. It tastes grainy, like brown sugar. And the rest of it is just chocolate chip ice cream. So nothing exciting. The wake and bake ice cream core was the same. Super grainy."
BenJerrys,1,Waste of money,"AWFUL. I’m a huge fan of Ben & Jerrys cookie dough and this was such a disappointment. The cookie dough core crumbles and is as hard as a rock. It’s grainy and tastes terrible, too."
BenJerrys,1,No core,"I bought this for the cookie dough core and there is no cookie dough core.. this is the second pint of ""core"" I've cream that didn't even have a core. I'm really disappointed."
BenJerrys,1,Terrible,"Ice cream tasted like artificial sweeteners and the core was nothing like cookie dough in taste or texture. Was very disappointed, totally not worth the price (or calories)"
BenJerrys,1,the core is quite awful...,"The cookie dough core taste terrible, like it has some kind of sweeteners in it. the after taste lingers like sour milk...don't buy this!"
BenJerrys,1,Grainy cookie dough,"I was looking forward to trying this, but it was a let down. The ice cream was decent, but the cookie dough core was grainy and sad."
BenJerrys,1,HORRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I was excited to get Ben&Jerrys ice cream after a long time. I expected it to be another amazing experience. I brought this Pint of I cream only to find that the cookie dough core was small, it wasn’t EVEN A CORE! It was off to the side, fell apart. It’s a whole scam idk why they even continue to sell this Ice cream in this condition. I should have checked the reviews. Y’all obviously don’t pay attention to customer reviews cause you would notice this is unacceptable. Smh"
BenJerrys,1,Grainy “cookie dough” core,This is terrible! The cookie dough core is basically brown sugar with chocolate. I wish I could get my money back.
BenJerrys,1,More cookie,I’m pretty sure there is less cookie dough in throw then there is in the regular one
BenJerrys,1,No cookie dough in this version,Tried this for the first time and the other reviews summarized it perfectly.
BenJerrys,1,Something is very wrong,"I regularly purchace and enjoy the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream so I thought I'd try the new Core version that had just arrived in NZ. What a big mistake, it is disgusting. It does not taste the same and the cookie dough is awful, its grainy and basically inedible. I deeply regret straying away from the normal version and strongly recommend people read and heed the advice of the majority of other reviews here and avoid this strange disastrous flavour!"
BenJerrys,1,Great Potential -- Poor Exection,"My all-time favorite ice cream is, hands down, original cookie dough by Ben and Jerry's. So I was thrilled to see they had a core version featuring cookie dough as its magical center. Boy was I disappointed to taste the grainy, overly sugary, poor substitute they chose to use in place of their original cookie dough recipe. Ben and Jerry, please rework this product and try using your original winner of a recipe for the cookie dough core!"
BenJerrys,1,Bad Texture!,"I bought this today at my local HEB, and thought I would try it since I love the chocolate chip cookie dough, honestly because I love cookie dough, but the cookie dough in this ice cream is grainy. It is hard to scoop because of the grainy texture, making it hard to actually enjoy the ice cream. The ice cream itself is amazing, but what’s the point of buying chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, if you don’t enjoy the cookie dough."
BenJerrys,1,This girl needed ice cream better than that :(,"I'm sick and all I wanted was cookie dough ice cream. I couldn't find the classic that I could always count on, so I went with this. The core was a crumbly texture and it tasted like I was eating clumps of brown sugar. The ice cream flavor just tasted like milk with unsweetened chocolate and I am not a fan of solid milk. I recomend bringing back the original cookie dough ice cream. :( Seriously so sad and disappointed."
BenJerrys,1,Ice Cream Failure,"My husband loves all ice cream. But not this one. I gave it to him after I decided I couldn't eat it. We both agree the ice cream tastes like rice pudding with a lot of water and the cookie dough core does not taste anywhere near as delicious as Ben and Jerry's cookie dough. We haven't had a bad Ben & Jerry's flavor until this one! If you're craving cookie dough, go with any of their other cookie dough varieties."
BenJerrys,1,Disappointed,I bought this because the store i went to didn’t have my favorite chocolate chip cookie dough pint. I figured it may be just as good since it still is cookie dough. I was wrong and extremely disappointed. The core was crispy and broke every time I tried to scoop it. The flavor was more like toasted piece of bread than cookie. I will stick with the original chocolate chip cookie dough which has never let me down.
BenJerrys,1,Horrible- Gritty and Grainy and Gross,This was a perfect example of a marketing bumble. If I get a spoonful of ice cream I want each bite to have a little bit of goodness in it. I shouldn’t have to go digging for it. The “core” is nothing but a grainy sugar that is flavoured with something that vaguely represents dough. I can actually imagine the assembly line pumping out this stuff. Soooo disappointing.
BenJerrys,1,So disappointed,I saw the ad and went to the grocery store that night to buy some. I ate around the cookie dough core bc it was so grainy and sugary and not anything like the cookie dough in the other ice creams that it wasn’t even worth it. Let’s be honest - there’s so many calories in these pints that if I’m going to eat it I need to love it and this was way below par
BenJerrys,1,Be warned!,I was so excited for this ice cream as chocolate chip cookie dough it my favorite..I was expecting a core of cookie dough with the same taste and texture of the bits in the regular ice cream. Instead it is gritty and doesn't even taste like cookie dough. I am extremely dissatisfied. Even my 11 year old son thinks it's terrible. Please reformulate!
BenJerrys,1,Off Texture,"Ben and Jerry's Ice cream has been my favorite since I was a little kid, however...this one the textures were off. The cookie dough was grainy and tasted like flour or another ingredient was missing. The ice cream was icey in texture, not creamy. I had to double check I didn't get a frozen yogurt version. Wondering if the batch was off?"
BenJerrys,1,Where is the cookie dough??,I was expecting to be overwhelmed with cookie dough deliciousness however I am left wondering what went wrong. There was no “core” and really no cookie dough. The ice cream in my opinion is ok but the lack of cookie dough was super disappointing. There is way more dough in the original. My advice skip this one.
BenJerrys,1,Not what I expected,"I tried this thinking it would be as good as regular cookie dough. I was highly disappointed. The ""core"" was not anything like the regular cookie dough. It was very grainy and sugary. Also, the pint was not fully filled. There was an empty space about 2/3 the way down. I will not buy this product again."
BenJerrys,1,Disappointed,"I was so excited to try this ice cream since cookie dough ice cream is my favorite. I was very disappointed in the cookie dough ""core"" it was very chalky and almost sand like. The flavor of cookie dough was not there at all. And the core was more of a sliver. Really hoped this would have been better."
BenJerrys,1,Not the same as their cookie dough ice cream,I bought this thinking that it would be the same cookie dough as what's in their regular ice cream that I like but this cookie dough tastes like watery sand. I would love to see this product made with the same cookie dough in the core as what's in the regular chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.
BenJerrys,1,So Sad,"This had great potential - you guys should have stuck to your regular cookie dough... no cookie dough lover would enjoy this... the ""dough"" core is gritty, the texture is horrible, its like eating sand in your ice cream. nasty. I love ben and jerrys but this is a big let down remake the recipe!!!"
BenJerrys,1,Unfortunately not good,"I eat a lot of Ben and Jerry's, like a lot. And I was so stoked to see this flavor because I love the cookie dough in your other ice creams. Unfortunately mine was as everyone else described. The cookie dough was too runny, and tasted like melted butter. The ice cream itself was great as always."
BenJerrys,1,So so bad,"I bought this since there was no choc chip cookie dough in stock and figured it would be similar. The dough is like eating unprocessed brown sugar, grainy and way too sweet. The ice cream is fine, but I still threw it all away because the dough is so bad. DO NOT BUY THIS FLAVOR, EEEEEKKKKK!!"
BenJerrys,1,Cookie dough core is gross,"I wanted to try the core ice cream so bad so even though it wasn’t on sale I went ahead and bought it cause it looked soooooo good, honestly it’s the most nastiest ice cream I’ve ever tried!!! The core has such a weird texture to it, and taste nothing like cookie dough, super disappointed"
BenJerrys,1,So disappointed,"I just picked this up and was excited to have more cookie dough... But I almost couldn't find any. I had three small little spots of cookie dough and it was very grainy, not like the cookie dough in the original cookie dough ice cream. Will NOT be buying this one again. Wasted my money"
BenJerrys,1,Texture is off.,"Cookie dough ice cream is my favorite. While the flavor is fine, I don’t enjoy the texture of the cookie dough core. It’s almost just like flavored sugar, and doesn’t really provide the cookie dough feel. Overall, it’s not bad, I was just craving cookie dough and this missed the mark."
BenJerrys,1,Expected so much more,"I have been anxiously waiting for this flavor to hit stores near me, and I finally found it today. Was soooo excited to try it out! However, was extremely disappointed when the “cookie dough” core didn’t even taste like cookie dough! Not even close on texture or flavor unfortunately."
BenJerrys,1,Worst flavor ever,I bought this a week ago at Walmart Neighborhood Market and I was so excited to try it. But then the moment came that I did and it was terrible! There hardly any cookie dough pieces and the core was grainy and gross. Do not buy this flavor it is the worst I’ve ever had.
BenJerrys,1,it's not cookie dough,"got this Sunday and was so excited to try it, as my local store was out of the kind my boyfriend likes (chubby hubby) and it was like eating brown sugar bombs. there was no cookie dough. maybe the ice cream box got mixed up when it was being packaged. I was NOT a fan"
BenJerrys,1,Disappointing,"The cookie dough core is a grainy sugar mess! The ice cream itself is also a huge letdown. It tastes nothing like the delicious chocolate chip ice cream in the usual cookie dough flavor. I have no desire to finish the carton, and I’ll never purchase it again."
BenJerrys,1,Bring back the original!,Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough used to be my FAVORITE B&J ice cream. I just tried the NEW Cookie Dough Core. The Cookie Dough in the new version has a strange taste and texture (not strange good). Please bring back the previous product. Pretty please.
BenJerrys,1,Gross,This was disgusting. I expected the cookie dough from the normal ice cream or half baked and what I got was a gritty mess. The ice cream wasn’t terrible but the cookie dough solidified my feelings. Skip this. Get the normal cookie dough instead.
BenJerrys,1,Nope!,"I was so excited for this to come out! Ben & Jerry's cookie dough is my favorite. However, the cookie dough core was just a gritty disappointment. The cookie dough core is so grainy and sand-like. I hope they reformulate and try again!"
BenJerrys,1,Save your money,I hope this isn't going to replace the regular chocolate chip cookie dough. It's more like a container of chocolate chip with hardly any cookie dough. The cookie dough doesn't even taste the same. I won't be buying this again
BenJerrys,1,Recipe changed,I bought this 4 days ago because I couldn’t find my regular chocolate chip cookie dough. Not only does the cookie dough recipe taste different but so does the ice cream I’m so disappointed. I will be going back to Hagen Diaz.
BenJerrys,1,Least favorite flavor,"This is my new least fave, even worse than Schweitzer’s Balls. The ice cream doesn’t have much flavor, just sweet. The core is puny: maybe 2-3 bites. The flavor of the core is ok (the only redeeming feature) but grainy"
BenJerrys,1,Ewww,Should have read the reviews first. I don’t even mind the grainy texture of the cookie dough. But it tastes horrible! Not like cookie dough at all. This could have been amazing. Super disappointed.
BenJerrys,1,Just gross.,"This ice cream tastes cheap and gross. I usually love all their stuff but this one was just nasty. The ""icecream"" tasted like they just froze a cup of milk and the cookie dough was grainy and crumbly."
BenJerrys,1,pretty disgusting,"the cookie milk ice cream is okay, chocolate chips are chocolate chips...but wow that cookie dough core is gross. so horribly grainy and not a good flavor. they should really offer people a refund"
BenJerrys,1,The worst one i ever had!!,I bought one because i love cookie dough. Ben and Jerry's is my favorite icecream after one bite I was so disappointed! The texture of it was the worst I couldn't eat I throw it in the trash.
BenJerrys,1,Sorry I bought it,The cookie dough core tasted more like a scoop of brown sugar with some chip chunks in it. I’m sorry but there was nothing cookie dough about it. Totally disappointed and a waste of money.
BenJerrys,1,Barely any cookie dough,This pint tastes great but feels like it has way less cookie dough than the regular one. I waited months for this and was really disappointment.
BenJerrys,1,nasty,ice cream is good but the cookie dough taste like brown sugar and butter . nothing like cookie dough it’s like sand dissolving on your tongue
BenJerrys,1,Cookie core grainy,"The core is grainy, cumbly, and nothing like the dough balls in regular cookie dough. :( Please rework the core!"
BenJerrys,1,Disappointing,"The core was a terrible texture, and barely had any flavor. Super grainy. Back to the regular cookie dough...."
BenJerrys,1,Hope this isn't replacing the regular cookie dough,"After being spoiled by chocolate chip cookie dough, my expectations were too high. Disappointed."
BenJerrys,1,Nope not close,"Ben and Jerrys fan since they started. This one falls way short. Minimal core, nothing special."
BenJerrys,1,Not Good,This was just a core of grainy sugar. Yuck never buying this again
BenJerrys,1,Expected Better.,How did you guys mess this up? It could have been so good.
BenJerrys,1,Awful cookie dough,The cookie dough sucked.i repeat The cookie dough sucked.
BenJerrys,1,Whatever,Was no cookie dough at all. Ripoff. So enraged ...
BenJerrys,1,PLEASE IMPROVE IT.,"I am a loyal Ben and Jerry's customer and most of their flavors are amazing and when I saw this in the store I was so excited to try it. But I am beyond disappointed in this. First I will say that the cookie milk ice cream part is DELICIOUS. I wouldn't change anything about the cookie milk ice cream. However, I was looking forward to a big center of that same delicious cookie dough that's in the other pints of ice cream (like the half baked). But instead, after digging through all the cookie milk ice cream I found a tiny little section of cookie dough, not even a core. Just a chunk on the side of cookie dough that isn't even actual cookie dough. It LITERALLY tastes like sugary sand and has a grainy texture. Nothing like the cookie dough I always enjoy in the other flavors."
HaagenDazs,1,So Disappointed to Have Bought These By Mistake,"I was looking forward to the decadent treat that is the chocolate bar with dark chocolate coating, so was disappointed and frankly sort of sort of grossed out by what I bought instead. During the current COVID nightmare, I have turned to HD ice cream as my guilty pleasure - every night just about! I love the squares with the “cake” layer that I discovered recently (but the calories, I don’t even want to guess) but also love the tried and true hard chocolate on chocolate bars. But the texture of the “soft dip” turned me off completely and the ice cream too does not seem as rich and creamy. I won’t get used to this product and indeed, gave the remaining two bars away."
HaagenDazs,1,Terrible - Go Back To The Original Recipe,"I have been eating the chocolate bars for many years. I have loved them and purchase them all of the time. This new ""Soft Dipped"" is not even close to the way it used to be and I think is a very bad decision on the part of the company. I have no idea what research (if any) came up with this idea, but it may be one of the worst since Coca-Cola changed its formula. I bought three boxes. I ate one bar so far, and am not looking forward to eating the other eight. Shame, shame, shame."
HaagenDazs,1,Cost-reducing version with more sugar,"In addition to quietly reducing weight from 82 g to 77 g per bar (i.e. >6% reduction), the so-called ""soft dipped"" with ""soft chocolate truffle coating"" is loaded with more sugar, whose granularity can be felt right away--a hallmark of cheap chocolates--and palm oil instead of cocoa butter (apparently HD knows how to get around FDA's definition of chocolate; using the adjective ""chocolaty"" let them get away with less-expensive non-cocoa butter). BTW, increasing the sugar content is primarily responsible for the softness since sugar lower the freezing point."
HaagenDazs,1,Chocolate ice cream is not creamy or tasty.,"Admittedly I haven't had Haagen Daz very regularly for years now. I remember their ice cream being thick, rich and creamy. The chocolate inside this bar is nothing like I remember their chocolate tasting like. It's flavorless and icy. It tastes like some kind of low fat alternative or vegan ice cream."
HaagenDazs,1,So disappointing - don't taste like anything!,I just gave one of these bars a second chance thinking a Haagen Dazs bar had to be better than what I remembered these bars tasting like. The texture of both the ice cream and chocolate coating is off and there's no flavor at all- very unsatisfying. I definitely wouldn't buy these again.
HaagenDazs,1,Horrible,"Bought these by mistake. Icky waxy fake chocolate tasting coating that sticks to your teeth -- and hands and clothes and anything else in the vicinity. Like other reviewers, I peeled the nasty coating off and just ate the vanilla ice cream."
HaagenDazs,1,Disappointed,"When I saw the package, I was so excited. Yet, when I got home and had my first bite on it, disappointment came in. The ice cream inside is plain. For the soft chocolate coating, the texture is alright, and somehow expected as it is soft dipped, but the flavour isn't that chocolaty. Overall, it is far worse than the experience the Belgium chocolate flavour pint ice cream can provide me. It is not the quality I would expect from Haagen Dazs."
HaagenDazs,1,Very Disappointing,"This is so far below the quality that I expect from Haagen-Daz. I bought these to see what ""soft dipped"" would taste like. Although the texture of the chocolate is not for me, it tasted ok. My problem is that it tastes like dark chocolate which is not stated on the label. The real disappoint was the ice cream, which was icy, tasteless, and nothing at all like a regular HD ice cream bar. I will definitely NOT be buying these again."
HaagenDazs,1,NOT Good,"I normally LOVE dark chocolate ganache, but the ganache coating on these bars is bitter and gritty. The ice cream doesn't taste like premium ice cream. It tastes like cheap store brand ice cream with a bunch of those various gums and no egg yolk. I bought all 3 flavors and threw them out. Such a waste of money for a low income family. These are not up to par with the quality products that Haagen Dasz used to make."
HaagenDazs,1,Not a fan off soft coating,I bought these because the original wasn’t in stock. Don’t like the soft coating but at least it peels off easily to eat the ice cream so it’s not a total waste of money.
HaagenDazs,1,Super chalky taste,"Very disappointed- first because i thought I got vanilla, second because the chocolate ice cream is super chalky taste- bummed!"
HaagenDazs,1,Thick slimy chocolate coating,Yuck! The chocolate is thick and somewhat slimy. Not a good product.
HaagenDazs,1,Icy and flavorless,"Worst ice cream experience ever! I normally buy the Chocolate peanut butter and was excited to see a lighter version of my guilty treat but that soon diminished after the first bite. When I opened the carton I saw what looked like freezer ice build up :-( I was willing to see past this, left it out for 5 mins for this to melt before trying another bite. The ice cream although soft now was flavorless and had a strange flavor, definitely not peanut butter. It was so bad that i threw out the carton. Very disappointing in texture, lack of peanut butter flavor and overall experience."
HaagenDazs,1,Pretty bad,"I literally hate this flavor
I had really high hopes but the ice cream was so dock hard even after letting it sit out for a really long time that it was very enjoyable to eat
The peanut butter was about the only good part as the little chocolate specs were so tiny that you could barely taste them and what you could taste was chalky chocolate"
HaagenDazs,1,Really Disappointed,"I honestly expected much better from a premium ice cream brand I normally love. My pint was rock hard coming out of the freezer, and had a texture reminiscent of ice milk. There was virtually no vanilla flavor in the ice cream base, so it tasted like sweetened skim milk. It was crumbly and the texture really didn't improve as it warmed up. There was very little peanut butter or peanut butter flavor. The only redeeming quality were the chocolate chips.
Kinda wished I had saved my money on this and just bought the regular slow churned ice cream I like. I'm not sure how a 2/3 cup serving of peanut butter chip has more calories and is much less satisfying than Kroger brand slow churned ice cream, but here we are.
Next time I get Haagen Dazs, I'll be sticking with caramel cone, that's for sure."
HaagenDazs,1,Peanut Butter Chip Purgatory,"Understandably a light ice cream is going to lack the creamy satisfaction of a full fat version, but this was reminiscent of ice milk for texture, and only had a one hard clod of peanut butter on the bottom of the carton. The chocolate was adequate, but the whole experience is summed up as brazenly forgettable waste of calories, especially since it's a Haagen Dazs product generally know for its quality."
HaagenDazs,1,Icy ice cream with very little flavor,I just tried this flavor for the first time tonight and it's the worst light ice cream I've had: was very icy and had little flavor. I'm not sure how this made it past the testing phase to be honest. I did get a decent amount of peanut butter swirls but that was the only pro. I will be throwing the rest of it away.
HaagenDazs,1,Disappointed,"I was expecting more peanut butter, but there were just a few frozen bits settled at the bottom. I know the ice cream is a light ice cream, but it really tasted like frozen watered down skim milk. I expected more from such a successful brand."
HaagenDazs,1,it was terrible!,"When it came in, it was all melted and it was holes all over the package so the so called ""ice cream"" dripped out! there was barley any flavor, there was so little amount of peanut butter! basically it was completely terrible"
HaagenDazs,1,Basically just watered down vanilla ice cream,"There were barely any chocolate chips in it, and the 'peanut butter swirl' was more like an occasional fleck of peanut butter. The vanilla base just tasted like an icy, watered down vanilla ice ream. Not worth it."
HaagenDazs,1,No flavor......tasted a lot like watered down milk,"The new HEAVEN Peanut Butter Chip ice cream was terrible. No flavor, very little peanut butter and tasted a like watered down milk."
HaagenDazs,1,Barely any peanut butter,Super disappointed. There was barely any peanut butter and the chocolate chips were chalky and flavorless. Hard no on this one.
HaagenDazs,1,Very disappointed,"I bought a box of the this a week ago and there was no issue with the overall taste. Then just a few days ago I bought another box this time around the box was different (I guess it was the birthday addition because that’s what was stated on the box. Anyway the taste of the ice cream was horrible it just tasted like frozen milk, nothing at all like the one I had from the first box, and the outer part was not only thinner but tasted cheap almost like a generic nestle bar which is disgusting and there was way less almonds. I was very disappointed because the cost wasn’t cheap at my local super market. Don’t think I’ll be purchasing again if this is the new taste of them :("
HaagenDazs,1,Quality has gone down the drain,"I grew up eating Haagen Daz and it was always a treat for me. I haven't had it in a couple of years because I'm lactose intolerant and lactase pills don't work, but I was really craving that creamy, rich vanilla and think chocolate and crunchy almonds that I remember from my childhood in the 90s. But I regret wasting my money on something that tasted cheap as if it were a knock off of the brand. The bar is now 50% smaller, the chocolate is not thick and rich, the vanilla was icy, watery and did not taste like vanilla. I'm very disappointed with this product and will not waste money on haagen daz anymore."
HaagenDazs,1,Super Disappointed ☹️,"When you purchase Haagen Daas or Ben and Jerry’s or Talenti, you expect a Superior product because of the price point and also the reputation. My husband and I have purchased these bars for years from Costco and sadly, we will not be purchasing these anymore. As two people with lactose intolerance, ice cream has to be amazing for us to suffer through the side effects that follow. The new bars have hardly any almonds (the one I just ate had three almond pieces on each side) and the chocolate coating is thin and brittle. Please fix this product because we genuinely enjoyed eating these. The margins that were cut from an expense perspective are not worth it to your clientele."
HaagenDazs,1,"NOT AS IT USE TO BE!size, taste quality is bad :-(","As I was looking on the web about the past size and the quality of these bars, I bumped into this website. I couldn't agree more with all the post that the quality of this product has gone down the drain. As I still have the empty ice cream stick in my mouth, while I am writing this review, who knows this could be the last time I am buying your product. What really bothered me the most is the size more than the taste, not to mention which is not as good as it used to be. I might look for another better brand, which I can think of few that I liked before. Either way the taste is more important to my family than the size. Very disappointed with over all many products that Costco sells including this one."
HaagenDazs,1,You claim that they haven't changed. Sure.,"these used to be the best bars. Now, the coating is paper-thin and tasteless, and the vanilla (whatever it is) is gross. Don't bother about sending an email to ""find out the problem,"" nor do I want coupons--you couldn't pay me to eat another one. You already know what the problem is: You changed it to save money. Everyone noticed, and no amount of PR will salvage your stupid decision."
HaagenDazs,1,Why take a winning product and ruin it?,"Just purchased the big box from Costco last week and they are not the same product. Would like to believe it's the batch however, from all the reviews/comments it's not limited to the batch but is a change in formula/recipe. Best description of the ice cream is a flavorless, frozen, watered down milk. Chocolate is also not very flavorful. Taste's artificial and texture is chalky - why would Haagen Daz risk reputation & market share to save a few pennies? Will not be purchasing again - will be returning the product to Costco."
HaagenDazs,1,"Used to be good, not anymore.","These ice cream bars are not the same as they used to be. In fact, nowhere near what they used to be. If Haagen-Dazs first came out with this current version years and years ago, they never would have gotten off to a good start and would not ha e been popular. I will never buy these again. They're too small, too thin now, and not nearly as indulgent as they used to be. The ice cream didn't even seem as thick and creamy as it used to be. Did another company by them out? There ice cream bars are now just generic ice cream bars. I'm going for Dove bars from now on."
HaagenDazs,1,Bland taste. Was expecting so much more,Chocolate shell was very thin and fell off after a couple of bites. Ice cream was bland and not smooth and creamy. My taste buds were very disappointed.
HaagenDazs,1,"Had it after 5 years, what happened?","It tastes like a knock-off, like soft-serve. Haagen Daz is not SOFT SERVE! The ice cream is not dense, I used to enjoy the thick dense haagen daz vanilla ice cream with almonds bar, it took many licks to get it down. Now it's like soft serve. I don't know why they changed the best ice cream bar in the world. I feel bad for todays' kids. I need to find another brand that can provide the dense haggen daz ice cream of the past. Thanks for the memories, wish you guys would bring back the original recipe from years ago."
HaagenDazs,1,WHAT HAPPENED?!,"Sadly, these bars have seriously lost their good quality taste. I use to love these bars! The bars are much smaller, ice cream is not as smooth and it those delicious chunks of almonds are basically gone. I’m disappointed, hopefully they’ll bring back what is missed."
HaagenDazs,1,Nestle Always Ruins EVERYTHING!,"Yes, these bars have definitely gone down hill in quality, just as Nestle did with Turtles. Bland taste, change in texture - a regular purchase no longer worth buying."
HaagenDazs,1,Sudden Drop in Quality of Taste and Texture,The vanilla ice cream tasted watery and had a gritty texture similar to low quality ice milk products. In the past the bars that I purchased tasted top quality with a delicious dense but rich creamy flavorful taste and texture. I will not be buying the Haagen-dazs ice cream bars again as it is a waste of my money. I just hope that the pint of strawberry ice cream that I bought at the same time still has the great high quality taste and texture it had the previous time I bought some about 2 months ago.
HaagenDazs,1,Vanilla Milk Chocolate Almong Bar,I can't believe we all are disapointed with the same flavor and purchasing them from Costco.My son noticed the subpar ice cream right away.It was like ice milk my mom use to eat when she dieted.Not cream at all I feel like I wasted good money on bad ice cream 15 bars of a bad thing isn't good at all.
HaagenDazs,1,Insert ghost here,Boo! Huge turn for the worst. done buying Hogie from costco. Is no stars a rating? Guess I'll go for 1 star.
HaagenDazs,1,What Happened??!!,"These used to be the Best ice cream bars and now they have cut quality! More air, less chocolate, smaller bars, ice cream not as rich.
Do they really think people won’t notice???"
HaagenDazs,1,size insanely decreased,"I know that minumum wage is raising but that doesnt mean that the sizes should decrease, your change made it taste worse and look like a childrens popsicle that comes with stickers. Honestly im going to stop buying your products and buy dryers for now unless you guys can prove to me that ur products are worth the price. Atleast dryers can prove to me that qulity over quality is better."
HaagenDazs,1,Please bring back the original,"For years, Haagen Daz had THE best ice cream and the VSA bars were everything, with the thick Belgian chocolate coating full of roasted almond pieces encasing the best vanilla ice cream available. I guess everything must come to an end. It's a real shame. And the fact that consumers are still being charged premium prices for subpar product ads insult to injury.
In fact, I would much prefer a run of the mill version over what has become of the HD brand. The chocolate coating is awful, the nuts less plentiful and all the rich specialness of the vanilla ice cream is gone. Blue Bunny is MUCH better. I don't know if HD is farming production out to new Mars or if they just wholesale changed the recipe but until I hear from consumers that they have returned to their origin as l taste and quality, I am DONE."
HaagenDazs,1,Unacceptable product change,"This is so disappointing. Haagen-dazs was my absolute favorite ice cream and I would purchase these bars every single week. This product has been changed terribly. The size of the bar is almost half the size it used to be. I bought the REGULAR size bars and it's a joke. The ice cream is not anything like it used to be, it tastes artificial and it is not creamy. The chocolate coating is now generic and bland. This product is not worth the price anymore. I won't be buying Haagan-dazs products ever again unless these changes are reversed."
HaagenDazs,1,Flavor not the same! Less almonds and smaller,Recently bought a box from Costco and the flavor is not as smooth and creamy as before. The bars are also significantly smaller and have less almonds. I have a picture from about a year ago and the image is significantly different! Disappointed because it was my wife’s favorite ice cream bar.
HaagenDazs,1,Icy and watery instead of creamy and smooth.,"What happened to this summer favorite? I got two boxes from the Costco this month and they don't taste like Haagen Dazs anymore. Did your guys changed the formula or something? Is so, it's really a shame. Your guys need to stand up to the Nestle instead being another corporate sellout."
HaagenDazs,1,Very Disappointed...,I recently purchased a box of vanilla chocolate almond ice cream bars at Costco and to my dismay I was appalled at how small they were with half the almonds. What was management thinking. Going forward I will find mother ice cream bar to eat. What a shame!
HaagenDazs,1,Not what it used to be,"This has been a great product over the years but the last Costco box is obviously a vastly different bar, it even has a different shape. It appears and tastes like the ""ice cream"" has been cheapened to ice milk. The rich taste is gone! Too bad!"
HaagenDazs,1,Changed for the worse,"Most of the negative reviews here already nailed it: these just don't taste the same anymore. I've thought this a few years now so I avoided buying them but while at Costco I saw a box and decided to give it a chance. I'm sorely disappointed which led me to google if the formula changed and here I am. I also grew up eating these bars, I remember the overwhelming smell of roasted almonds whenever I opened a pack. They don't have that smell now. Ice cream also tastes icy and bland, it doesn't even taste the same as Haagen-Dazs' vanilla ice cream in pints."
HaagenDazs,1,Super disappointed,The creamy texture is no more. It’s definitely dropped in quality and tastes a lot cheaper than it did before. Sadly I’ll need to find a new favorite ice cream.
HaagenDazs,1,What happened to my favorite ice cream bar?!,"I have been eating these since I was a child and was sadly surprised about the decline in size and quality of the product. The ice cream bar itself has become significantly smaller although the price has not! The next noticeable difference was the decrease in the amount of almonds embedded in the chocolate. Previously no small bite was without almonds but now the nuts are sparsely place in the chocolate shell. Next the chocolate shell is much thinner than before. Lastly vanilla ice cream doesn’t taste like the high quality Haagen Daz I’ve always love. I don’t purchase ice cream often and when I do it’s normally exclusively Haagen Daz but with the decrease in quality and the same price, I may have to rethink purchasing their products."
HaagenDazs,1,Icy Milk water,"We recently purchased the 15-pc package from Costco ( #43774254 on the wrapper). Were shocked to find out that the size shrunk and poor taste... the vanilla ice cream wasn't creamy, it was like icy milk water, very odd texture... it's not ice cream without cream! Very disappointed! Would have returned to Costco if we didn't discard the box for easy storing in freezer. What happened to the Haagen Dazs high quality?"
HaagenDazs,1,What happened?,"I bought a box from Costco and they're not the same! They're smaller, it's not as creamy, there are less nuts. What happened?"
HaagenDazs,1,Gross and gritty,I really loved these bars but recently the quality of the ice cream has gone down. The chocolate exterior is still delicious but the ice cream interior is for lack of a better term gritty. It’s bumpy and almost sandy. Not smooth and creamy like it used to be. I thought I got a bad box and purchased two more boxes on different occasions. Each time I’ve had the same issue. Very disappointing and sad.
HaagenDazs,1,Bars aren’t the same,I have loved your ice cream for as long as I can remember. We don’t get them often but occasionally for a special treat. Tonight we opened a box from Sams Club and we were very disappointed. I didn’t want to believe it. I was holding out hope maybe it was just my bar. Then my 12 year old son said “these taste cheap and icy.” There is some graininess in the vanilla ice cream that has never been there. I thought maybe a thaw and refreshed type thing might of happened but Then I did a search in case my box wasn’t the only one. Sure enough I’m not. The chocolate is thinner but still has good flavor. Has the product changed that much? Will they go back to the way they were? I find the ice cream in the pints to still have that rich creamy texture.
HaagenDazs,1,Changed for the worse,I was greatly disappointed in the new lack of quality for the almond ice cream bars.
HaagenDazs,1,Downhill fast,"This used to be my favorite Ice Cream bar. Just had one, and as other reviewers have mentioned the size is much smaller. That is nothing new, every brand is making their products smaller in size. Unfortunately, the great taste has managed to disappear as well. The vanilla ice cream tasted icy and bland. Rather than a nice creamy vanilla, it almost crumbles. Very disappointed."
HaagenDazs,1,Not the same quality as before!!,"This company can deny all they want that they haven’t changed their recipe but come on do you think your consumers are stupid? Thinner coating of chocolate, significantly less almond bits, icy watered down filling. What a disappointment! Not worth continuing to pay a premium price for a product that no longer lives up to its “quality standard“"
HaagenDazs,1,"Poor taste, very disappointed","The taste of the vanilla ice cream in these bars is awful now. The ice cream tasted very grainy and watery, not rich and creamy how it used to. Did something change? Feel like the price is so high on these still and very low quality. I would have been better off buying store brand bars for half the price."
HaagenDazs,1,Used to be good,I used to love Haagen Daz ice cream and bars but not anymore. They are now half the size and half the flavor. You can definitely tell that they are using cheap ingredients. The bar hardly has any almonds on it. Not wasting my calories on them anymore. Looking for a new ice cream treat.
HaagenDazs,1,"Changed product, disappointing","Will never buy another box from Costco again. Another company cutting corners making the bars smaller and cutting the ice cream down resulting in a less than rich cream experience. This was my favorite ice cream to buy and when I sale at Costco, I always bought a box. Never again."
HaagenDazs,1,Vanilla Milk Chocolate Almond Bar,"Haagen-Dazs,
I agree with the the comments below regarding the definite changes in the Vanilla Chocolate Almond Bar: My boyfriend and I regularly buy this product because it's always been the best, and even when Whole Foods recently stopped carrying it (which was a poor choice) we went elsewhere to get it, even though it was out of the way."
HaagenDazs,1,This product tastes terrible!!!,I paid about $10 for a box of 15 @ Sam's Club and I when I tasted these bars they were terrible. When I tasted them a while back they were good but now they are terrible. How could haagen dazs get any ice cream wrong? This is a bad recipe.
HaagenDazs,1,Very very disappointed in quality and size,"This used to be my favorite and I would only buy Häagen-Dazs brand. But what happened to the size and less almond?? Even the taste is less creamy, so very disappointed, now I'll have to look for another brand that won't cut on quality and size."
HaagenDazs,1,Frozen Milk,"I bought these because in the past we have loved Haagen Dazs. When my husband and I tried them tonight, we both thought they tasted weird. The chocolate was good but the ice cream tasted like frozen milk. We couldn’t even finish the bars."
HaagenDazs,1,Awful.,These used to be my favorite ice cream bar on the planet. Now the texture is awful an it’s more like frozen milk instead of the creamy goodness I was used to. What have these people done to it? I will never purchase again.
HaagenDazs,1,Ice milk?,I haven't had these in a long time and I was looking forward to a decadent dessert. Boy was I disappointed it tasted like ice milk with ice crystals in it. Is this a new formula?
HaagenDazs,1,Nothing like the original version!,"So disappointed! I have been eating them since I was a little child. I bought a box from Costco in April and it was the original size and ingredient quality. I just bought a new box from Costco and got the mini version. Everything was wrong! Tiny size, less chocolate coding (much thinner), less nuts, even a smaller popsicle stick. Not the high quality incredible the original version had and that I am used to. It tasted more like a crunch ice cream bar than Hasgendazs. I am so sad!"
HaagenDazs,1,Shrinking in size?,"Was craving something sweet. My husband bought a 3 pack of bars.
Opened it up and about fell over. It was so tiny.
Same price less product.
Not cool."
HaagenDazs,1,Smaller bars,My favorite ice cream bars have less chocolate fewer nuts & are smaller. Does the size vary if purchased at different locations? Totally disappointed.
HaagenDazs,1,Not creamy,"This has a very ice milk taste, not creamy like the low budget brands.
Might as well buy the cheaper low budget brands."
HaagenDazs,1,Changed,"There is something different about the size, coating, and shape of the bars. It is not the same - lessor quality."
HaagenDazs,1,So disappointed :-(,"I have fond childhood memories with my mom and dad getting these every Friday in the Summer as an indulgent treat for us to enjoy. I decided to grab a box as it has been at least 25-30 yrs since I had one and wow!!! Not at all what they used to be, so sad! Half the size, ice cream tastes watery like a good humor bar and the coating is barely there. Very disappointing, this is not a product that needed any changes at all...it used to be perfect and now it's just trash."
HaagenDazs,1,Delicious but way smaller,They are much smaller then they used to be. For the price charged it’s ridiculous!
HaagenDazs,1,Not Like it Used to be,"If Haagen Dazs pays attention to reviews and notices that so many reviews are saying that the product is just not as good as it used to be then how is it that they continue to respond with not admitting they changed the product? Consumers are not stupid? It is not the same! Ice cream is not as rich and creamy (more air is pumped in it), chocolate coating is not as good (taste like chocolate coating used on cheaper bars vs rich milk chocolate) and it is smaller. Also it does not satisfy. What I mean about not satisfying, is that a rich high quality ice cream bar will melt slowly in your mouth from each bite (from its creamy richness) and as you get close to finishing the bar you begin to feel satisfied from your indulgence and not wanting more. Haagen Dazs used to satisfy....now it does not. Shame! As I rate this product at one star, I am referring and comparing it to how it used to be and not so much as the product on its own today, since if one was to eat a Haagen Dazs bar for the very first time today it would stand up fine to many standard bars on the market. The issue is just that a Haagen Dazs bar is a premium bar with a premium price and that deserves a premium rich quality product....just like it used to be."
HaagenDazs,1,What happened to the quality?,"This isn't the Haagen-Daazs I used to remember. Their ice cream used to be quality, and I would always buy their brand even though it costs more because the quality is worth it. I bought a box of their bars a half an hour ago, and it's really small, the ice cream doesn't taste rich, the texture is not smooth, but icy, and the chocolate is chipping off onto my lap or the floor. I might have to find a different quality brand for my ice cream. So disappointing."
HaagenDazs,1,Terrible,I thought these were as years ago. Forget it. i will trash them
HaagenDazs,1,Quality is terrible now,"I used to love these but as some other recent reviews mentioned, they must have changed the recipe. The chocolate on the outside is still good, but this is in no way like the Haagen Dazs ice cream in the pints. The ice cream in the bars now has a very thin ice milk consistency, not rich and creamy. I thought this was a fluke but it happened the second time I bought them as well. I hope it was just a bad batch and not a permanent change to the product."
HaagenDazs,1,Ice Cream or Ice Milk?,"We've been buying your ice cream bars for a long time, but decided this would be our last box. Our issue isn't the chocolate or the almonds; it's the ice cream. Instead of the rich, creamy decadent ice cream that used to be inside the bars, it tastes like you use ice milk (not real ice cream). You need to return to the formula that made your ice cream bars so popular; otherwise, your company will not survive."
HaagenDazs,1,Icy and Bland,"They must have definitely changed the recipe regardless of what PR is telling people, bought from costco recently, these things aren't even creamy! You pay for quality and you get some bland icy dollar store junk. Hope you guys take note of the lost sales and decide to actually fix the problem, will be moving on to other brands, Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream is still delicious consistently so I'll be ok."
HaagenDazs,1,"More ""ice"", less ""cream""","Recently purchased a box of these bars from Costco. First bite and we noticed the product wasn't the same. The chocolate was not as rich and the ice cream was, well, just icy. There was no creamy richness to the ice cream section and it was devoid of flavor. I rarely buy treats like this and it was severely lacking in so many things. The only thing this bar was full of was disappointment."
HaagenDazs,1,Poor Quality,"Forgot to mention bad stomach problem after eating these lately & Purchased occasionally for few yrs. The whole bar taste of poor quality chocolate & also the vanilla. Expect refund from Sams w/no problem, even tho I've had to thro out many after starting to try eat, as if the next in this bix would be better, NOT. Let it go before but not this time & waste my $. Disappointed. Ribbed."
HaagenDazs,1,Not even of selling quality.,I tasted 1 ice cream bar and it was so bland it did not even taste like a haagendazs brand. This was nothing like it used to be. I can not believe how plain it tastes like. It does not even taste like ice cream! I am so disappointed in this brand. Please change the taste. I really should have read the reviews on this item before wasting my money like everyone else.
HaagenDazs,1,great taste but being cheated with product,"hello,please give me my money worth,before we can get started ice cream gone,sorry no photo to show,ice cream bars was so small,hello,have you heard the slogan,where the beef/where the ice cream ,YES I WOULD RECOMMEND FRIEND S,,FAMILY MEMBERS
OTHERS,ONLY IF YOU MAKE UP ICE CREAM SHORTAGE I RECEIVED WHEN I BROUGHT BARS IN WESTERN BEEF"
HaagenDazs,1,Sad and Disappointed:(,"I bought a box a few days ago and to my surprise it was a new and improved version!
The ice cream was not creamy, in fact, it was very icy and and left a greasy film on top of my mouth. The chocolate was too soft and when I took a bite it all fell apart! The taste is not at all the same. Help! We need the old recipe back!"
HaagenDazs,1,Ice cream gritty,Bought a box of these ice cream bars at Costco. I usually love them but this entire box was awful! The ice cream was very gritty! Not smooth and creamy like it usually is. If this is a new recipe for the ice cream I will not be purchasing this brand again!
HaagenDazs,1,Everything about this has gone down hill,"The vanilla ice cream is much less creamier than it used to be, and you all have confirmed you changed it. The chocolate is also of lower quality than it used to be. It breaks off in pieces, like a cheap ice cream truck bar, nothing like it used to be."
HaagenDazs,1,Terrible quality ice cream,"I don’t understand what happened! I love these bars and bought them from Costco. My wife and I took a big old chomp, and what did we find? It was like eating grainy frozen watery milk. Where are the craveable slam duckable ice cream chocolate delights??"
HaagenDazs,1,Quality went down the drain,"Bought a box from costco, completely different from the batch from last week
It's not ice-cream at all. not creamy but icey, worse than those free ice-cream machine from buffett. I rather have safeway brand ice-cream than this. Absolutely disgusting"
HaagenDazs,1,What happened the to ice cream???,"I bought a box from Costco and the ice cream is horrible. I guess I shouldn't say ice cream; maybe it's ""ice milk"". Not pleased at all. I have been buying these bars for years, but decided to buy a whole box and I will be taking the back to Costco."
HaagenDazs,1,Horrible!,"I would give it zero stars if I could. These ice cream bars taste nothing like they used to. The ice cream tastes watered down and the chocolate isn't as smooth anymore either. Never buying again. I purchased a box from costco, horrible ice cream."
HaagenDazs,1,I wish I read the reviews before I bought those,"I cannot believe Haagen-Dazs could produce such a product. It is just as the other reviews say, the chocolate coating is thin, and the ice cream is like frozen ice, not creamy at all!! I would say the Dove bars are 100000 times better."
HaagenDazs,1,Half the size and half the almonds and taste,"Just purchased 2 boxes and wife and kids complained that they are now half the size, and don't have as much almonds and taste like ice milk. No more HG unless they improve and get the size back. What a rip -off!!!"
HaagenDazs,1,The Bar Shrank,I just bought 2 boxes of the almond bar. The bars are substantially smaller now. I felt like I got scammed. I would have made paid more for the original size bar. I won't buy anymore of your products.
HaagenDazs,1,Used to be great now the sizes are 40%,Smaller sizes I have to eat 3 to get same effect as 1 used to be. As people stated quality went down too. Not sure if its true or not but feels like it. Sad. This is an outrage!
HaagenDazs,1,Rip off,Every 6 months this ice cream sold in costco becomes smaller and smaller for the same price coming now that I can eat whole ice cream in 10 seconds
HaagenDazs,1,taste cheap,"I googled ""Costco Häagen-Dazs bars low quality"" and found this page. Yeah, the ice cream has no taste and the chocolate is super thin."
HaagenDazs,1,Not Haagen Dazs quality,These bars are an embarrassment to the Haagen Daz brand. Their regular ice cream on the other hand continues to be very good.
HaagenDazs,1,"extemely icy, grainy texture of the ice cream","ive bought these multiple times but something is off. the ice cream had a icy, sandy texture and was not at all creamy."
HaagenDazs,1,Awful,"Bought them from Costco in Manteca, CA
They are awful, taste like ice milk, will not buy again"
HaagenDazs,1,Chalky filmy dry taste,I would give it a 0. I am very disappointed in the change in the icecream
HaagenDazs,1,Really?,The size is smaller that a credit card... I am very disappointed.
HaagenDazs,1,Changed for the worst,"I used to eat these all the time as a treat with my parents when I was younger. After I got out of the military and haven’t had them in a couple years, I finally convinced my husband to buy them as a treat for us. The first bar was like ice milk instead of the delicious, creamy vanilla ice cream I know it was like. The chocolate was thinner with less almonds, and I know this changed because younger me would always carefully take off the chocolate first then enjoy the ice cream, even after eating it there is a gross filmy texture in my mouth, like the same feelings after eating a super artificially made ice cream, it didn’t hit the spot at all like it used to. I thought maybe it is because it is too cold or whatever, then ate another the next day and got the same unpleasant results. That’s when I knew I wasn’t going crazy and googled this page, and alas, I am not the only one who noticed this. My husband has never had them before and will eat anything so he can have the rest of the box, but until the reviews say they are back to how they used to be, I would rather not buy anything from you guys, cause as much as I enjoy the small carry sized ice cream, I can’t reason myself to indulge in it.
If you guys haven’t changed anything but it isn’t the same, why not change and look into what you guys can do to make it the original?"
Breyers,1,Disappointed,"Was very excited when I saw this new flavor as I love peanut butter ice cream. Texture / mouth feel was fantastic. Very creamy, much more than what I expected from a low carb ice cream. However I found the flavor extremely lacking, the ice cream was very bland and had little to no peanut butter flavor. There was a small swirl of peanut butter in the container however it was way too small for the size of the container and many scoops of ice cream had no peanut butter swirl at all. Will not buy again."
Breyers,1,Bring back the swirl!!,"I'd buy six or eight cartons of this every single time I saw it on the shelves. I'm not joking when I say that this wonderful treat made my first year as a diabetic bearable, and helped me get my AC-1 down to 5. It was as good as any 'real' ice cream, with those thick, salty swirls of peanut butter blending so perfectly with the sweet, slightly peanut buttery ice cream.
Well, the swirl is gone and I'm devastated. My favourite treat is dead! I couldn't believe my eyes when I scooped into my new carton and found it uniform. The sweetness and subtle flavour that blended so well with those yummy swirls is just painfully generic on its own. Less flavour than Vanilla.
I'll be switching to another brand's no sugar added options until the swirls come back. Can't describe how disappointed I am. There are so few options as a diabetic and the old recipe was such a standout. Now? Not so much."
Breyers,1,What happened to CarbSmart Peanut Butter ice cream,"I love your CarbSmart Ice creams, especially the Peanut Butter. Well, let’s jut say I used to love it. The last few cartons that I have purchased no longer have the peanut butter swirl that gave it its wonderful flavor. The last several cartons are tasteless...no peanut butter flavor and no swirls. I can’t imagine why you would change something that was perfect. I’m sad to say that you’ve lost a customer."
Breyers,1,It WAS good UNTIL they changed the recipe!,"We were buying the Peanut Butter flavor six at a time. It WAS really good with the large swirls & chunks of Peanut Butter. They changed the recipe and removed all of the swirls. Now it tastes very bland and a little like cardboard. WHY did you do it Breyers, WHY?"
Breyers,1,Changed the recipe,"Like all the other recent reviews, this ice cream is not the same. This was a poor choice on someone's part. Tastes exactly like the vanilla now. I finished a box that said it expires in July of 2020 and it was perfect. The next box expires April of 2021and it was terrible. I assume this new change allows the product to last twice as long. It will have to because I'm not gonna eat it unless I really get desperate."
Breyers,1,Where’s the swirl,"You removed the best part of this ice cream - the peanut butter swirl... why? The first time I bought this it was great! This last purchase was horrible... no peanut butter flavor and no swirl. So, so disappointed in the change. Will look for something else for my low carb life style. Bad move Breyers!"
Breyers,1,What happened to the peanut butter swirl?!,My husband and I were buying these 4 at a time & were really enjoying UNTIL they removed the peanut butter swirl! WHY change the recipe Breyers? Clearly based on these posts everyone liked the swirl. Please bring the swirl back or we will stop buying!
Breyers,1,Lost a customer,I loved the peanut butter because it had.... PEANUT BUTTER. Now there’s nothing and it’s lost it’s taste. What a pure disappointment. I’m sure someone high up thought removing the best part was a good idea and sadly I’m sure they still have a job.
Breyers,1,No peanut butter swirls..,Was an excellent product until the peanut butter swirls was removed recently. Will no longer buy this flavor until it is fixed. Why would you sabotage a great product and make it mediocre?
Breyers,1,Disappointed,"This was my favorite Carb Smart flavor until the removal of the peanut butter swirls. It was my favorite part, and gave the ice cream a lot of flavor. Now it is just blah with very little flavor. I was buying this consistently, but never again. Extremely disappointed that Breyers would take a great product and ruin it. Why?"
Breyers,1,No peanut butter,I liked the old recipe better when it had chunks of peanut butter swirls in it. I was disappointed they changed it.
Breyers,1,Bring back the original recipe,"I loved the original recipe, with the peanut butter swirl. Now it's been very disappointing and refuse to purchase any more. You find something that fits your low carb lifestyle and now it's not right, very devastating."
Breyers,1,Not good at all,"I was so excited when I saw this today. I love the carb smart vanilla and usually add my own peanut butter to it. It’s tricky to blend though, so this was like a dream come true! Well, Dream shattered! This tastes like dirt. Or more accurately, it tastes like wet cardboard smells! The peanut butter swirl is okayish but the ice cream flavor is awful. Why not just add a peanut butter swirl to the already delish vanilla?! Ugh. Just not good. So disappointed."
Breyers,1,Why?,"Why did you change the CarbSmart Peanut Butter ""Ice cream?"" I haven't liked ice cream since I was a kid, but I tried some when this flavour was bought by a happy mistake. Now I've two cartons in my deep freeze that I'll probably throw out or give to a neighborhood kid."
Breyers,1,1 star until you bring back the peanut swirl!,Title says it all. This WAS my favorite product like... ever... UNTIL THEY TOOK OUT THE BEST PART! Bring it back. I beg you!
Breyers,1,A very SAD diabetic,"To say that my husband and I loved Carb Smart Peanut butter ice cream is a understatement!! The swirls were so heavenly running through it. I would buy 6 to 8 cartons at a time. Then the last I bought had no swirls! I was stuck with 8 containers of bland,tasteless cream that we couldn't even tell it had a flavor at all. Why did you do this to your loyal customers? Diabetics are deprived already with very few good choices! Please,please fix it and give us more flavor! Thanks!!"
Breyers,1,Don’t fix what ain’t broken!!!!,"Why Breyers why?? The peanut butter WAS the best thing to happen for low carb dieters in awhile! That is, until you changed it for absolutely no reason. It has no peanut butter flavor now and I’m so disappointed that I just bought my regular stockpile of 6. Yuck. Change it back! Also bring back butter pecan."
Breyers,1,Was my favorite until the swirl went missing,This used to be my favorite ice cream until recently I bought a container of it and the swirls of peanut butter inside were completely missing. I can't imagine who in the chain of command thought this would be a great idea but I won't be buying it again. Note to Breyers: google Hostess Suzy Q debacle.
Breyers,1,Why did you change it?,The Peanut Butter was my favorite flavor and we would go out of our way to purchase it from the one store that carried it. The new recipe is awful. Why get rid of the swirl? It is bland and flavorless now and lost the additional appeal of the swirl texture. Very disappointed with this change.
Breyers,1,Amazing ice cream until they ruined it,"Much like many others, I was absolutely in love with this ice cream, as were my parents. Both me and my mom would regularly buy multiple cartons at a time because we loved the creamyness of the ice cream mixed with the tougher texture and stronger flavor of the peanut butter swirls.
When we found some cartons without the swirls and just containing a plain cube of ice cream with a dull flavor, we both just prayed that it was an older recipe and the newer ones contained the swirls because Breyers understood it was an improvement.
I am truly baffled to find out that the plain cartons were the new recipe. Just why? It's painfully boring now. I still buy them on the off chance I get one with swirls, which is easily a no-brainer 5-star ice cream. Hopefully they come to their senses and revert the horrible mistake they've made."
Breyers,1,The swirl is worth 4 more stars,Came here to voice my dissatisfaction with everyone else. Bring back the previous formulation for 5 stars. Currently tastes like vanilla with a hint of peanut butter. Didn’t even finish the current gallon I have and will not ever purchase this current formulation again.
Breyers,1,#bring back the swirl!!!,"I've been purchasing & enjoying your delicious Carb Smart ice creams for some time now. Although the chocolate & vanilla are very good, the Peanut Butter is far & away THE BEST! I recently bought a carton with no peanut butter swirl & at first I thought it was a mistake. Then I noticed your packaging changed as well - no swirl. So disappointing, flavor is poor without the best part. Why did you remove it? Please bring back the swirl!"
Breyers,1,I agree with all the other OUTRAGED customers!,This ice cream was the BEST low carb half gallon money could buy.......UNTIL they took out the Peanut Butter swirl!!! WHY!!??? If they don't add it back I am not going to buy it any more.....
Breyers,1,Bring back the peanut butter swirl!,The first time I bought this ice cream I thought it was fantastic...because it had the peanut butter swirl. I occasionally buy Rebel low carb ice cream but I bought the Brewers this time because it was on sale. As soon as I took the first scoop I was wondering where the peanut butter swirl was. It does not taste like peanut butter and I won’t buy this again. Obviously everyone else here is missing the peanut butter swirl again.
Breyers,1,flavor doesn't taste right,This is not very tasty. There is an odd taste that isn't like l peanut butter. Too creamy
Breyers,1,"missing the swirl, too","Just finished half of the carton looking for the swirl (the only flavor source in the recipe.) Threw the rest away! Not even a warning on the front like ""New Recipe"" or ""Now with less flavor."" Will not be purchasing again. You fooled me this time...but not again! I work too hard for my money to waste it on this."
Breyers,1,Ribbon gone,As with most low carb dieters I loved this product when it was first tried with the pea nut butter ribbon. The product itself is ok but the ribbon made it great. Paying a bit more is not an issue for someone on low carb when the treat is good enough because there are so few options. Fortunately that is changing and I’m hoping executives revisit their stance on this products recipe before the sales diminish to a point where the line is eliminated. You have an opportunity to capture more market share and help keep upstarts out of the frozen treat space. Many of us find this without advertising. Imaging what will occur to sales if it is realized this is not just for low carb dieters but also is reasonable for those with diabetes. Please consider making the treat the way it was.
Breyers,1,Where is the swirl???,I have been buying your Peanut Butter Carb Smart ice cream for the past year and a half. I have been on this Keto diet and found that I could still love good ice cream and not rack up on carbs. The swirl is what made the ice cream. Big chunks of peanut butter that would literally melt in your mouth. But now some genius has taken it out and it is just plain ole peanut butter ice cream. I will be looking for another brand seeing that this flavor was all I ever bought. Thanks for the disappointment.
Breyers,1,Horrible without the peanut butter swirl,It’s horrible without the swirl bring it back. Loved it with the swirl. Came here to see what was going on because I have still been getting the swirl ever once in awhile. We only shop at 2 store. Try rotating the stock if you’re gonna change it.
Breyers,1,The swirl is gone!,I used to love this with the peanut butter swirl. Why would you take out the best part? I will never buy it again unless you go back to the original recipe. So disappointed!
Breyers,1,WHY??? did you remove the peanut butter swirls??,Why would you remove the peanut butter swirls from the ice cream? It no longer tastes like peanut butter? Cost savings??? So disappointing...
Breyers,1,Use to love it,Love the old peanut butter no carb but no taste now
Breyers,1,YOU RUINED IT!,"WHY did you change what was my favorite low carb ice cream ever?!? as others have complained, it is HORRIBLE without the ribbons/swirls of peanut butter. that made it over the top delicious & I was raving to everyone about it. so they tried it & also hate it because you removed what made it great. SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED & WILL NO LONGER BUY ANY OF YOUR LOW CARB PRODUCTS."
Breyers,1,Disappointed,I love Breyers ice cream but recently switched to the Carbsmart flavors. I have been so disappointed in the change in recipe of the Carbsmart Peanut Butter. Gone are the ribbons of peanut butter and the flavor.
Breyers,1,Where's the swirl!?,I really loved the peanut butter ice cream..... when it had the peanut butter swirled throughout! What happened!? Please bring back the swirl!
Breyers,1,Absolutely tasteless,Was extremely disappointed in this product. Would never purchase again. Even the dog didn’t enjoy it. Ended up throwing most of it away.
Breyers,1,VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT,"It USED to be the BEST Ice Cream Ever!!! PAST TENSE.... How in the world I go to store wanting Ice Cream, decide to pick up my favorite, Breyers Butter Pecan and there are NOOOOOOOO pecans in the whole DARN container (I use darn because it would let me say the other word. That's how upset I am). Are you Kidding me. I grew up on this Ice Cream. I don't like very much, but I could Always count on My Breyers Butter Pecan Ice Cream. Until Now, what is going on. This is ridiculous. I will NO LONGER PURCHASE (WASTE MY MONEY) ON THIS ICE CREAM EVER AGAIN. If I wanted Vanilla I would have brought Vanilla. How could this happen? The Ice Cream use to be Less than $6.00, not it's higher and less quality. If you pay more the product should be what people expect or better quality. Come on, what is it going to take to get what you pay for these days. I use to love or was happy to taste the pecan. It was like roasted pecans in delicious vanilla ice cream. Now, it's just Vanilla ice cream. NO MORE"
Breyers,1,Very disappointing - Butter Pecan Ice Cream,"So disappointed to have a few bites on Breyers Butter Pecan Ice Cream only to have the worst after-taste left in my mouth. Before looking at ingredients, I already knew there was corn syrup in it!!!---AND sugar!!! So sad. I expected more from Breyers, the same brand that I can rely on for clean, simple ingredients when it comes to vanilla and chocolate ice cream (only 2 flavors that have simple ingredients, for now anyway). As a point of differentiation, please expand your line to meet the consumer demand for healthier options in terms of simple and clean ingredients. Please do not continue to cheapen your product and brand with cheap ingredients."
Breyers,1,What Happened to the So-Called Purity,"I grew up in the Philadelphia area; in fact, I used to live a few doors away from the old Breyer's house at 16th & Locust Sts. Used to be a devoted Breyers lover; and Butter Pecan used to be my favourite. But, now it's Hagen Das. Why? Real ice cream doesn't use corn syrup and gums. BP used be Natural Vanilla with added pecans and that was all. Now it's this strange viscous goo. Ever since Unilever took over they've been adding all this junk so as to produce the product more cheaply and therefore sell it cheap. Sometimes it's better to sell a little less at a little more and sell better Mr. Breyer would be very sad if he were still with us."
Breyers,1,Deeply Disappointed!,"Breyer's has always been my go to brand for ice cream because it was actually ice cream not some synthetic tasting frozen goo! I know they had frozen dairy dessert flavors but the normal staple flavors like butter pecan were actual ice cream. I was deeply disappointed to get the butter pecan home and find that it too is now filled with poor ingredients, corn syrup etc. Unfortunately, this will be my last purchase of a Breyer's product and I will be more diligent in reading labels on products that I have always purchased as companies are changing ingredients and not alerting that to us on the label!"
Breyers,1,Horrible quality!,"I grew up in the Philadelphia, Pa. area and enjoyed the Brewers experience along with Tastykake as a wonderful privilege. However, over the last three years I’ve been immensely disappointed with the quality of this product. The cream tastes doctored, not pure, and the pecans are sometimes burnt and have bits of hull in them which almost makes me gag, ughhh! Biting into that is torture! I can’t ever see myself buying this product again until you fix these issues. Your competition has surpassed you and they give me more for less. You’re gonna need to raise your game, Brewers, if you expect to remain relevant."
Breyers,1,Breyers Butter Pecan dairy product,"Breyers Butter Pecan frozen dairy dessert, I was excited to try an old childhood favorite again! I must admit that the first spoonful or two tasted great, until I realized something was a bit ""off"" I noticed a somewhat gummy texture and was instantly suspicious... I checked the side panel of the carton and was shocked at what I read! Artificial additives and gums! Whatever happened to the Breyers pledge of honest easy to read ingredient list? Who was it a kid named Mikey stuttering over another leading brands ingredients? And clearly could read milk,sugar, cream (?) and strawberries on the Breyers label! That said the frozen dessert is misleading when seeing the Breyers label. I noticed that it had the unilever trademark (soap makers) While it was sweet at first taste, the end result will be purchasing a real ice cream product- not this artificial gummy concoction made cheaply."
Breyers,1,Recipe changed ... to GOO,"Horrible, has the consistency of warm tree sap with the sickening sweet goo of corn syrup. One Awful spoonful proved this brand is no longer allowed in my home.
New recipe ingredients developed in a laboratory don't belong in ""Real"" iced cream."
Breyers,1,"Butter Pecan...more like ""Butter""","I purchased a 1.5 quart container of Butter Pecan ice cream tonight, 11/2/2017, from Walmart on Hinkleville Road in Paducah, Kentucky. I'm about 3/4 of the way through it and the ""pecan"" count is like 1/8 of 1 Pecan. A tiny piece of pecan. It doesn't look like there's any pecans at all. I'm not exaggerating. I must have got a bad batch. Since I don't see a place to lodge a complaint on the website I guess I'll have to do it here. If you're looking for pecans in your butter pecan ice cream forget about Breyers."
Breyers,1,Ewwwwww!,"The consistency is totally different from before. I echo the other reviews on its cheap tasting consistency. It’s like foamy, light, and NOT the way ice cream should taste. Very gross- I hope all Breyer’s doesn’t taste like this now, but I won’t be finding out. If I’m eating ice cream, I’m certainly don’t want to be wasting those calories on cheap tasting goo. Back to Ben & Jerry’s."
Breyers,1,This is NOT Ice Cream,"Like Many reviewers, This will be the last purchase of Bryers. This is no longer Ice cream but instead Frozen Dairy Dessert. Tastes like lots of filler and cheap sweetner.
What ever Happened to simple ingredients?"
Breyers,1,No pecans in the butter pecan,"Breyers was the only ice cream I would eat but I don’t eat ice cream often so imagine my surprise when my favorite wasn’t like it used to be,,,,middle of the container and I haven’t had one pecan yet...should have labeled it butter ice cream"
Breyers,1,Not Butter Pecan,"I had my boyfriend pick up some Butter Pecan ice cream up as I had a pregnancy craving for it. The commissary only carries this brand of it. When I opened it I thought it looked different, so I read the container, and while it's called Butter Pecan, the small print says it is vanilla with buttered pecans. So it is literally just pecans in vanilla ice cream. You should stop calling this butter pecan. It's misleading. Who puts vanilla ice cream in butter pecan?"
Breyers,1,Just plain ICK!,Breyers brand used to stand for quality and taste. Unilever has turned it into a mediocre “frozen dairy dessert.” So sad!
Breyers,1,"No, No Just no. - Do not buy","I love butter pecan ice cream, but this was not good. I had 2 spoons of it and I threw it in the trash. I don't know what happened to this ice cream but the texture is off the taste is bad and the pecan are rubbery.
DO NOT BUY!!!!!"
Breyers,1,So sad the recipe changed,"I am so disappointed that they changed the Butter Pecan recipe. It used to be THE BEST Butter Pecan ice cream in the world with the most perfect natural sweet cream flavor and savory pecans. Now it is just another crap product on the shelf of fake tasting ""ice cream"". I raved about it to my husband only to be embarrassed when he finally tried it. Shame on Breyers for going against the original owner's philosophy and recipe. Not buying this anymore."
Breyers,1,Tasteless Butter Pecan,"I grew up on Breyers ice cream, and I worked at a drug store when I was 16 that had a soda fountain. We sold only Breyers and it was GREAT. That was 55 years ago. What you're selling now is awful. Who in the world talked you into destroying your wonderful product? It no longer has any flavor. Based on the other reviews on this page, I have to question whether you'll be able to stay in business. I will not purchase your ice cream again."
Breyers,1,Beware - not real ice cream and artificial flavors,Not your Father's Breyer's anymore. It is sickeningly sweet from the high fructose corn syrup and the texture is very bizarre from all the gums. They are also trying to pull a fast one on their marketing websites and in the packaging acting like this is ice cream - the fine print is this is a frozen dairy desert. Aka. they can pump it up with as much air and artificial chemicals as they want. Unilever why'd you ruin a good thing?
Breyers,1,This is a gross chemical dump,This “frozen dairy dessert” mess is Unilever’s attempt to scrape additional margin at the expense of product quality. We want an indulgent quality treat; this might as well be Butter Pecan Tide Pods. Breyers has violated its brand standards beyond recognition. Notice how the don’t show the FDD language in promo pictures? Breyers is a commodity bottom of barrel brand now. Next Unilever will make QTips out of insulation.
Breyers,1,Very disappointed,"I have always liked Breyers vanilla Ice Cream. This week I decided to try a different flavor but was very disappointed with the carton of Butter Pecan. The pecans were soft, not buttery and roasted as stated. Many were BITTER and completely inedible. I have thrown away the remainder of the carton! I do hope that this is a minor slip up and not an indication of a major overall decline in quality of Breyers products."
Breyers,1,Did not meet my expectations,"Went to the store craving some butter pecan ice cream. The store did not have the brand I wanted to so I figured Breyer's was a safe choice remembering that I used to enjoy it as a kid. The ice cream is edible but they should have labeled the ice cream ""Vanilla with pecans"", not ""Butter Pecan"". Definitely misleading and to some degree mislabeled. I don't plan on buying this brand ever again--truly a shame."
Breyers,1,NOT ice cream!,"As a kid, I had always held Breyers in high regard. It was fairly dense, had only the ingredients it should, and tasted great. Now it can’t even be called ice cream, it’s ‘frozen dairy dessert’. It’s got corn syrup, gums and other fillers. And it’s so full of air it has the texture of chilled foam. Gross! I told my wife we will never buy another package of Breyers."
Breyers,1,Frozen Dairy GARBAGE!!!,"Not anything remotely close to the ""ice cream"" I grew up with. Extremely disappointing. ""Frozen Dairy Dessert"" is not ice cream. Tasted like vanilla bean whipped topping with stale pecans...which were very few and far between. What happened to the simple all natural ingredients we all loved?? Replaced with artificial fillers to save a buck?? What a joke. #epicfail"
Breyers,1,Horrible ... NOT ice cream,"I am an ice cream aficionado. My preference is home made ice cream with real cream and real sugar. As for store-bought ice cream, I used to buy Breyers ages ago because it was the standard by which all others were measured. I stopped buying Breyers ages ago when they reduced their 1/2 gallon carton down to a reduced size. I love ice cream; why would I want less???
My wife bought some Breyers Butter Pecan today because the store had a ""Buy one / Get One"" sale. The stuff was horrible; it wasn't even ice cream any more. It had a gooey texture, rather than a natural IceCream-texture; the flavor had a sickening sweetness to it rather than the natural Breyers flavor of ages ago; and lastly, it had an after taste that was strange and unpleasant. This is not the Breyers natural ice cream that they used to make ages ago.
This stuff is so far removed from the old natural Breyers that I wouldn't even call this stuff ice cream any more."
Breyers,1,Disappointing~ Pecan Shells in ice cream,"So, I posted a review last week concerning Pecan Shells in the ice cream, get an email stating ""It cannot be published to the website, but.."" with a picture of the word Breyers. It's okay for you to post someone else's review of Butter Pecan with No Pecans, but not a post with the shells in the box. This Will be the LAST box of Breyers I buy"
Breyers,1,coconut oil?,"I thought I was buying ice cream, since it said Breyers on the container. I admit I was in a hurry, but I thought I was safe from gypsy tricks or product changes. When I was a kid, I remember eating Breyers Butter Pecan Ice Cream. Not any longer...it is now referred to as a Frozen Dairy Dessert because they altered the ingredients."
Breyers,1,Pecans were rancid!,"Butter Pecan is my favorite ice cream flavor of all times, and I set myself the challenge to try as many brands as possible. This ice cream is nothing more than vanilla favor with added pecans, and the nuts tasted stale or rancid. I ended up throwing out the rest of it. Horrible experience! :("
Breyers,1,Frozen dairy garbage,"It used to be the best ice cream ever when I was growing up. Now, it's ""frozen dairy dessert"" that tastes disgusting and artificial and has a weird texture. I've noticed that most of their ice cream flavors have now made the switch. I'm so disappointed that I can't eat Breyers anymore."
Breyers,1,Why,Butter pecan ice cream is just not good. If I were looking at all the different ice cream flavors at the store I don’t think I would look at butter pecan and decide that that was the ice cream for me. It has such a boring taste and I don’t know why anyone would buy it. Ew.
Breyers,1,You changed the recipe,Your recent butter pecan recipe change has not been an improvement from my perspective. For years I have purchased 3 containers per week. I’m now looking for another brand. I hope at some poin5 you go back to 5he old formula
Breyers,1,bad taste,"the butter pecan taste is so bad, this is the first time in my life I didn't finish a bowl of ice cream, I threw the whole thing in the trash. Years ago I used to love Breyers natural ice cream, now it's gummy, gunky, goo."
Breyers,1,No butter or pecans,Bought this butter pecan ice cream from my local grocery store. The next day I opened the product and found I had bought vanilla ice cream with a butter pecan label. No butter or pecans.
Breyers,1,No pecans ????,Seriously craving butter pecan ice cream and there is NO PECANS in the whole container ?????? Ahhhh why would you do that to a butter pecan lover .... is there a pecan shortage or?????
Breyers,1,The nuts were rancid,My Daughter had this for dessert. Awful. It is more like ice milk. It was chuck full of bad nuts. Stay away. Kroger has a Southern Butter Pecan that is to die for.
Breyers,1,Where are the pecans?,This product used to be filled with pecans. The most recent carton I purchased (9/16/2019) was basically vanilla cream with no pecans.
Breyers,1,Poor offering from Bryers,The lack of nuts is one thing but the consistency is not right. It seems foamy and sticky at the same time. Pass on this flavor.
Breyers,1,Will not buy again,I had the same problem with the rest of the people complaining about way less pecans than it used to
Breyers,1,Where’s the negative numbers,Will be looking elsewhere ! Filler Creme ? I will not return
Breyers,1,Butter Pecan,This is horrible. I think I’ll throw the carton away.
Breyers,1,No cookie dough,We basically got only chocolate chip and absolutely no cooke dough. We really thought maybe the cookie dough just settled but there was definitely no chewy cookie dough chunks as advertised.
Breyers,1,Disappointed,"I bought a half gallon of the chocolate chip cookie dough as a weekly dessert and have to say i was so disappointed with the flavor that I didn’t eat it.
Something seemed wrong with it as it smelled like spoiled milk and didn’t taste any better. I came straight home fro. The grocery store and it did not melt in any way. When I opened it that evening after dinner for some it didn’t seem right. Driving ll the way back to the store didn’t seem worth it.
I have all of the information from the package if you want the details.
This is the very first time I have ever been disappointed in your ice cream so I thought I would let you know."
Breyers,1,Ew,"Breyers used to have the best stuff, and the cookie dough was always a solid choice. But, we just bought it last night (after not having any for a few months) and... it tastes really bad. There's this strong aftertaste that reminds me of sweet and low (kind of that... hyper sweet, metallic sort of flavor). It does not appear to contain anything like that, which is perhaps even more troubling because ... why does it taste like that, then? It really shouldn't taste like that at all. It was really unpleasant.
It wasn't expired, or even close to expiring. Threw the rest of it away. Ew."
Breyers,1,Low Quality,I'm not sure where to begin. The aftertaste of this ice cream leaves a bitter taste in my mouth unlike any other ice cream product I've had before. The cookie was plentiful but honestly was the only good part of this product. I rather have collected all the cookie dough and ate it that way so that I could avoid the ice cream part. I've enjoyed other Breyer products and cannot understand why this one is different. Could it be that this ice cream product is not actually ice cream but Frozen Dairy Desert? Disappointing.
Breyers,1,What Did I Just Eat?,"First of all, ""Frozen Dairy Dessert"" is a terrible excuse for ice cream, and I already know this, but I was tired and not thinking clearly when I went grocery shopping. I thought I was putting actual ice cream in my cart. Imagine my disappointment when one evening after work I was looking forward to mowing down on some ice cream and I open my freezer to this atrocity.
Secondly, where are the cookie dough pieces and chocolate chips? If you consider every handful of bites enough to be satisfactory, you're sorely mistaken.
Thirdly, has anyone at Breyers actually tasted this nonsense? If so, they should be reassigned to another position.
Breyers, read your reviews. This is not a product that people enjoy eating."
Breyers,1,HORRIBLE,I purchased breyers chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and it's safe to say I will NEVER be purchasing it again . There is not one single chocolate chip or a hint of cookie dough anywhere in the ice cream . How does this even make it off the production line ? .
Breyers,1,Disappointing,The name Breyers is a well known and respected name. I have been buying Breyers for years and have never had this issue before this. I was very disappointed in the lack of cookie dough drops in the ice cream. It was chocolate chip ice cream.
Breyers,1,Not Good,"I'm a lover of cookie dough ice cream. Many people are, as well. When I saw that my local grocery store had this ice cream on sale, I thought I try it. While the ice cream was fresh, there wasn't much flavor and wasn't as rich as other brands that I've tried. What made me most disappointed was the cookie dough was not soft, chewy and rich like you'd expect. the cookie dough pieces were crunch and gritty (almost like a graham cracker like another reviewer mentioned). I will have to go back to the other brand that I've been eating until Breyer's develops a new recipe."
Breyers,1,This flavor is absolutely terrible.,"Breyers- what happened to this ice cream? It is terrible! I grew up eating Breyers strawberry and vanilla. This evening we opened a gallon of the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor and it tasted like it was made with spoiled milk. I immediately assumed the recipe changed to make it “healthier” and went to google for answers. My question is still not answered but I was sad to see this flavor even has horrible reviews all over your very own website!! Hello! It’s time to change the recipe! Please don’t send me a coupon, I don’t want it, I just want the Breyers I know and love from my childhood back!"
Breyers,1,What happened??,"I remember eating Bryers when I was younger and the flavor was so bold, the texture was perfect, and the after taste consisted of vanilla. This particular flavor had chocolate chips rather then waxy bits and cookie dough was softer and more flavorful.
Fast forward to today I grabbed this product for my kids to have an ice cream night and it was everything BUT a treat. My 4yr old that I call the foodie tasted it and said he didn't want it. My 11 year old saud "" what made you get this"". I ate a spoon and threw the rest away.
Kids turned down ice cream this ice cream... That's a problem."
Breyers,1,Not pleased with product,"Purchased Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream. Immediately upon scooping I thought i had purchased Vanilla Bean. This product failed miserably with barely any dough, chips and flavor."
Breyers,1,No cookie dough!,"I was expecting this ice cream to have loads of cookie dough, because I have purchased other flavors and they were very good. The picture indicates lots of cookie dough which is very misleading because this ice cream has hardly 10 pieces of cookie dough in the whole container. I literally searched the whole box of ice cream with a spoon and found little to no pieces of cookie dough inside of it . Please if your reading this Breyers add more cookie dough."
Breyers,1,No cookie dough...,I just bought one of these and it didn't have ANY cookie dough in it....awkward. Pretty sure that it was a mistake. Still mega disappointing. :/
Breyers,1,1 pint container= 4 pieces of cookie dough...,4 pieces of cookie dough.... very dissatisfied with ANOTHER unilever
Breyers,1,Weird after taste,"This cookie dough has some weird taste like they switched to artificial ingredients or just a plain inferior sweetener. I bought this a couple of months ago and I meant to keep a mental note not to make the mistake of getting this flavor again in your brand, but earlier this week I forgot and made the purchase anyway as opposed to another flavor. I am highly disappointed....again."
Breyers,1,Sour Taste - Not good,"Breyer's Cookie Dough ice cream was the only option at the store. They were sold out of the generic brand that I normally buy. So I decided to go ahead and spend the extra few dollars and try a name brand. I was very disappointed. The ice cream tasted strange, like whiskey, and it had a foamy texture. My first thought was to check the expiration date. It wasn't expired and I hadn't left it out of the freezer. I only live a few minutes from the store I purchased it from. I would not buy this again and do not recommend it to others."
Breyers,1,I Threw it in the garbage,The cookie dough tasted like it had spoiled. I bought another carton thinking something was wrong with the first one but it had the same sour taste. Yuck
Breyers,1,Tastes sour and leaves a bitter after taste,I purchased the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream. Tasted sour and leaves a bitter after taste. I originally thought the product might have gone bad but after reading other reviews I realized that it is a problem with the ice cream itself. Could not finish the bowl and will be throwing away the tub. Absolutely discussing!
Breyers,1,Thought it was spoiled,"Had a scoop (of my favorite ice cream) after my fiancé purchased a tub after a bad day, one bite in we were both sure that it had gone bad and pitched it. We bought a second tub later and it was just as sour tasting with a weird aftertaste, popped in back in the freezer to see if there had been a contamination recall for a batch. A quick look shows that the formula changed and everyone else noticed just as much as we did."
Breyers,1,Tastes like Cherry?,"My ice cream has very little cookie dough and has a strange after taste to it. Both my husband and I think it might taste like cherries or some artificial sweet fruity taste. Either way, gross!"
Breyers,1,Not good,"I have always liked Breyer's ice cream, but this carton was HORRIBLE. I thought my taste buds were off the first scoop, but the second time I tried it with my husband and it was just as bad. The vanilla tasted fruity and the cookie dough ""pellets"" were inedible. I'm throwing the carton away. I really hope the recipe changes back to what it was when the cookie dough was edible."
Breyers,1,No Flavor!,"The only flavor was the cookie dough chunks! The ice cream had absolutely no flavor! For the price we paid, I am more than disappointed!!"
Breyers,1,Cookie Dough is Awful,As an ice cream addict and a big Breyers fan I bought the cookie dough ice cream as soon as I saw it on shelf. I was immensely disappointed. The cookie dough tastes awful — like a metallic flavour and it lingers for a while ruining the ice cream so much more. I’m not sure what to do with the rest of the tub but definitely am not eating it
Breyers,1,Tastes Bad,"I always buy cookie dough icecream and decided to give breyers cookie dough icecream a try for the first time. The icecream almost tastes and smells like spoiled milk. And the cookie dough also tastes off with a very unsettling texture. After reading all of the other reviews, I know I'm not alone. Won't be buying this again."
Breyers,1,Disgusting. Barely any cookie dough.,"This is literally the worst ice cream that I have ever had. It barely had any cookie dough in it (it was mostly chocolate chips which is not why I brought the ice cream). Where there are actual cookie dough pieces, it tastes like chalk. The actual ice cream tastes like milk or spoiled milk or something. It is truly disgusting. My roommate brought the cookies and cream flavor so it doesn't have anything to do with how our freezer was or the store's freezer because the other ice cream tasted significantly better. Like something I would actually spend money one. I personally don't have a car to drive back to the store to get a refund or I would've and Breyer's doesn't have a return policy or a ""satisfied or your money back""."
Breyers,1,Tastes off,Can't put my fiunger on it but it just tastes strange. Left a bad taste in my mouth. Only ate a few spoonfuls and I am totally turned off. Gonna throw the rest away. The texture was also weird. Not thick and creamy. Best way I can describe it is almost spongy and foamy.
Breyers,1,Weird Chemical Taste,We bought this and it was just so bad. We couldnt place the weird aftertaste that just overpowers everything. It tastes so chemically and is super unpleasant to eat. Expiration date is so far away too and it was brand new. Throwing it away and never getting again.
Breyers,1,Terrible,"As with other reviewers, the taste was just off. It almost tasted like it was spoiled and I couldn't take more than a few bites. I wasn't about to go return it to the store so it was thrown out. It was not out dated or even close to that. I'm very disappointed."
Breyers,1,Choclate chip and cookie dough not worth the money,"So I've always bought ""Breyers"" brand for every ice cream flavor and have always fell in love. Cookie dough and chocolate chip is the exemption, the taste was disgusting, I was so disappointed. It's the only flavor from this brand I would not recommend."
Breyers,1,Disappointed,"This ice cream has an off, unpleasant taste.  We threw it all away.  Actually, I was looking to see if the ice cream was recalled and came upon this product website.   I was relieved to see it wasn’t recalled but am very disappointed with the product.  "
Breyers,1,What has happened?,This used to be one of our favorites. Bought some last week at Walmart and it tasted horrible. Thought maybe we just got a bad batch. Bought some today at public and it was also awful. Has the recipe changed? I will not be purchasing again.
Breyers,1,Save your money! Avoid this flavor!,Horrible flavor. I thought it tasted like sour milk. I checked the expiration date on the carton and online to make sure there wasn’t a recall because it was so TERRIBLE! I immediately threw it out. Never again!
Breyers,1,What changed?,"We used to purchase Breyer's chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream often. However, the past 3 times we have bought it the cookie dough has been terrible. Something has changed. Unfortunately, not for the better!"
Breyers,1,Tastes spoiled,"Purchased this from my grocery store and the taste was so bad I couldn’t eat it. It tasted and smelled like spoiled milk. From reading other reviews, I’m not alone. It was absolutely disgusting."
Breyers,1,Terrible Flavor,"This is by far the worst flavor of ice cream I have seen. The cookie dough is the worst part. It tastes bitter, like something is wrong with it. I will not be buying this flavor again."
Breyers,1,"No dough, strange taste","I used to purchase Breyers because their quality is usually superior. Unfortunately, the last couple times I've gotten cookie dough (my favorite), it's been disappointing. The most recent tub had a total of 5 chunks of cookie dough, and the whole batch had a strange, fake strawberry flavor to it. I let my wife try it before I said anything about it, and she independently said it tasted weird. Actually, I think the word she used was ""awful."" I'll be buying the off-brand from now on. It's much more affordable and the quality is so much better. Too bad."
Breyers,1,Awful!,The worst ice cream I’ve eaten. It had a after taste and would melt very quickly. There was NO dough! I would not give this to a family member!!!
Breyers,1,Disappointing,I was very disappointed with your cookie dough ice cream . There was less then ten cookie doughs . I basically paid for chocolate chip icecream
Breyers,1,SO bad,This was so bad. It doesn’t taste like vanilla at all but has more of a berry taste. Extremely disappointed and won’t be buying again.
Breyers,1,nasty,the cookie dough tasted artificial and bitter. it had an awful taste that i tried not to get it in my spoon when eating the ice cream.
Breyers,1,Weird After Taste,This is the only one of Breyers flavors that has a off putting after taste. Makes the whole experience unpleasant.
Breyers,1,What happened?,Breyer's needs to do a full investigation as to why this flavor tastes so weird. I am not buying Breyer's again.
Breyers,1,Tastes gross,I have tried this ice cream twice and both times it tasted like soap. Something about the flavor was way off.
Breyers,1,Not good.,I love ice cream and Breyers is one of my favorite brands - except this flavor. It isn’t good at all.
Breyers,1,TASTES LIKE GREEN OLIVES,I love Breyers ice cream but this is the worst ice cream I have ever had. Tastes like green olives!!!
Breyers,1,No cookie dough,I bought this and literally got through half the tube and only saw one piece of cookie dough.
Breyers,1,Tastes like Blueberries,I am not sure why but our carton of cookie dough ice cream tasted like blueberry flavoring
Breyers,1,Bad cookie dough ice cream,"Usually Breyers is my favorite. But not any more!
I recently bought Breyers cookie dough ice cream and the cookie dough was awful. Was like the dough had been freezer burnt and old and then added to the ice cream. It was not enjoyable at all. I threw the whole carton away. The cookie dough looked white like tablets. I’m going to explore different brands!"
Breyers,1,i want to give ZERO stars,"I remember Breyers was amazing before year 2000 so on a nostalgic icecream-craving spree I showed up at a gas station and purchased a tub of this for $8.50 CAD. Didn’t think too much when I grabbed it from the store’s freezer and the container was kinda squishy... Tossed it in the freezer for two hours and still came out squishy, meaning the ice cream is too soft (the texture I hate)... Ate a few spoonfuls and felt super disgusted I tossed entire tub into the garbage and vowed I will never purchase this brand ever again... gags"
Breyers,1,Horrible taste,"I thought my freezer was broken because the chocolate chip cookie dough “ice cream” I was scooping was completely soft. That was my first clue. Then there was the taste, which was just awful. Tasted like chemicals to me. So, I look at the container again and it says very small at the bottom, “Frozen Dairy Dessert.” Not even ice cream! Then I look at the ingredients, and it has all of stuff in it that I don’t recognize. I always bought Breyers because of their natural ingredients. Please do better than this."
Breyers,1,Tastes like cough medicine,"I can't believe how bad this tastes. I tried it last night, and both my wife and i couldn't get past the first few bites. I tried it again tonight to see if it was something I was eating, and it still tastes horrible.
I just don't understand how it's even possible for it to tastes so bad."
Breyers,1,Disappointment,"This product had a very strange taste that I cannot describe. I had been looking forward to it, and I am wondering if something was wrong with it or if it is just not good. There are plenty of other good choices for chicolate chip cookie dough ice cream or “frozen dessert”"
Breyers,1,What happened?!,"I grew up eating Breyers and cookie dough was one of my favorite flavors. I bought some for the first time in years and oh my god, it was HORRIBLE. It tasted like it was made with spoiled milk and it had a weird aftertaste that reminded me of bananas. So disappointing."
Breyers,1,Frozen dairy dessert.,"After staying away from Breyers for a decade, I decided to give them a try. What a mistake!!! Little did I know that things that are NOT ice cream hide out in the ice cream section of the freezer at the grocery store. I thought that this stuff was disgusting."
Breyers,1,Made to taste spoiled,Ice cream taste like sour milk. Yet the best by date is in a year and three months! It taste pretty bad (to what ice cream is suppose to taste like) but I am mostly worried that it might actually be spoiled milk. Who knows.
Breyers,1,Why can’t your ice cream BE ice cream,"I am horrified to recently learn that despite being packaged the same not all of your flavors are “ice cream”. I guess kudos to your Marketing team bc I thought every time I bought your “ice cream” I was feeding my family a good ice cream. Sadly, cream isn’t even on the ingredient list and you use skim milk. It’s no wonder you have to add corn syrup, sugar and fructose. ALL of your products will stay at the store rather than come home to my family from now on. I only wish I had known sooner."
Breyers,1,Really Disappointed,I've never had an issue with Breyers before but my most recent purchase had hardly ANY cookie dough in it. You might as well call this chocolate chip. Why am I paying $4-$5 for a product that cuts corners?
Breyers,1,Something is wrong or recipe needs to be changed,I was highly disappointed in the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice cream. It was almost like snow cream and did not have a ice-cream smoothness. The taste wasn't good at all and not up to Breyers quality.
Breyers,1,Weird taste,everyone says it taste sour but I wouldn’t say that. I just had a weird taste. I prefer publix brand of this flavor. All the other ice cream flavors for breyers are good except for this one.
Breyers,1,Very disappointed!,Tasted like cream. No sugar?!? I eat ice cream a lot! I would never turn down a bowl. Tonight I just couldn’t eat this fake tasting frozen cream. Yuk! Chocolate chip cookie dough.
Breyers,1,Awful,"Presented in a container made to look like ice cream, but it turns out to be a frozen dairy dessert. Tastes, fake, like chemicals, too sweet, too slimy. Avoid at all costs."
Breyers,1,What a let down,This cookie dough tastes nothing like the Mrs Fields you used to sell.... this one has no chunks in it and the ice cream is gritty.... disappointing
Breyers,1,This stuff is absolutely atrocious. Tastes rotten,"This is the first time, in 44 years, I've had spoiled ice cream. It was a great experience although I will never buy this great ice cream again."
Breyers,1,Disgusting,Got a full bowl that only had one piece of cookie dough that tasted like bleach. Disgusting. Not worth the $4 I paid For it.
Breyers,1,Worst “cookie dough” ice cream ever,"I’ve never tasted an ice cream I haven’t liked until now. The “cookie dough” pieces tasted disgusting, nothing like cookie dough at all and left the worst aftertaste. The overall ice cream was good but not with the cookie dough pieces. I picked them out and just ate the vanilla and chocolate chips. Very disappointed as I love the natural vanilla ice cream but will not be buying the cookie dough kind every again, will buy a different brand that actually taste good."
Breyers,1,Huge disappointment,"This used to be one of my favorite ice cream flavors. The cookie dough used to taste just like real cookie dough. I just bought a container after several years of not having this flavor and I'm so disappointed! It's nasty. The ice cream is tasteless and the cookie dough is dry, crumbly, and tastes terrible. Also leaves a bad aftertaste. Please bring back the original cookie dough!"
Breyers,1,No cookie dough,"I believe in he entire carton, there may have been five pieces of cookie dough. I purchased the loaded Brewers ice cream because I expected more cookie dough after purchasing Walmart’s brand a week earlier. I must say that Walmart had the better brand. Very disappointing. I could have purchased plain vanilla ice cream and been better off."
Breyers,1,Terrible,"I wish I could give this zero stars. The ice cream and chocolate chips taste weird and the cookie dough doesn’t taste like regular cookie dough, not sure what it tastes like but it isn’t good also the pieces are not soft and chewy. If you like being disappointed then I would recommend it otherwise stay away."
Breyers,1,disappointed,"hey breyers!! wow we love your ice cream and usually have no complaints, but our most current purchase of the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor tasted distinctly sub par. very sad to have the ice cream last more than a couple days, haha! hope to see improvement in the future."
Breyers,1,Absolutely not,"The flavor was horrible and at first it taste like rice pudding then the cookie dough kind of taste like bad coconut. Overall the ice cream was way to sweet and nasty , I don’t recommend but I do recommend turkey hills chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream ."
Breyers,1,No cookie dough,Cookie dough ice cream is my favorite so I was really looking forward to eating this one but there was next to no cookie dough! I thought maybe it would be towards the bottom but I only found TWO pieces of dough in a 1.5 qt tub. Very disappointing :(
Breyers,1,awful,There is something wrong with this icecream. It tastes like huckleberry and my family agrees. I will never be buying again sad to say. I have never had an issue with it before and I was very surprised and disappointed.
Breyers,1,What's wrong?,"All the reviews are old but we bought this flavor in January 2020 and it's terrible! It's poorly flavored vanilla with NO choc chip cookie dough AT ALL. THROUGHOUT the whole carton, none at all. Very disappointed."
Breyers,1,It does get one star for being ice cream,"Breyer used to make Mrs Fields Cookie Dough Ice Cream that was really quite good. This stuff they're selling now is horrible. It's tasteless, has very few pieces of cookie dough & it's a huge disappointment."
Breyers,1,Not Satisfied,"It doesn’t even taste like ice cream, let alone the cookie dough not tasting like cookie dough. About the only thing right are the chocolate chips. Disappointed, wish I bought something else."
Breyers,1,Very disappointed,"This is the 3rd time I have attempted to try the cookie dough once again from stop and shop in pawtucket and well, this batch once again is just vanilla no chunks anywhere...unreal"
Breyers,1,There’s something wrong with the cookie dough piec,"The cookie dough is dry and crumbles. It feels like it’s been dehydrated. Based on other reviews here it’s been a problem for a while. C’mon Breyers, fix your cookie dough."
Breyers,1,Terrible. Don’t Buy. No Cookies.,"We bought this ice cream and it had critically
No cookie dough. What a sham. I’ve been a huge bryers fan for a long time but am extremely disappointed with this flavor."
Breyers,1,Tuh*,Honestly ...this flavor was disgusting. There was no plus side to this what so ever and I will honestly never purchase again or give it a second chance
Breyers,1,Chalky cookie dough,"The cookie dough in this was dry and chalky. Made the whole point of getting cookie dough ice cream, or frozen dessert I guess, pointless."
Breyers,1,What happened Brewers??,"Taste like corn syrup! You use to be about quality, NO MORE!
Your frozen dessert is full of chemicals and taste fake!"
Breyers,1,Why did you change the recipe?,"Breyers coffee ice cream and Breyers in general has been one of my favorites for many, many years so I was extremely disappointed when I tasted this new version. What happened to using only simple, all natural ingredients like milk, cream and sugar? Now it contains things like mono and diglycerides, vegetable gums, and polysorbate 80. I noticed a different mouth feel right away. Oily and disgusting. Very disappointed and will not be purchasing this brand any longer. Sad."
Breyers,1,Terrible!!!,"Growing up, I used to love your coffee ice cream. It has consistently been one of my favorite flavors. But the carton I just bought is going straight in the trash. This new recipe isn’t bolder; it’s bitter!
I can’t begin to tell you how disappointed I am. It’s like a childhood friend has passed away. I won’t be buying your ice cream again until I see the old recipe returned. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!"
Breyers,1,Disgusting Unnatural,"Growing up, Breyer’s was the only brand of ice cream family ate. Coffee was a favorite for both myself and my mother. I decided to track down a carton yesterday, I opened it and on the first taste I was absolutely disgusted, it tasted like chemicals. I had to check to see if I’d purchased the wrong brand... no. Then I checked the ingredients and of course, no longer the traditional recipe is used. Corn syrup is the second ingredient! Xanthan gum?!? When I was growing up Breyer’s prided itself on natural, simple ingredients (I remember the commercial from the 90s stating only natural ingredients you can pronounce). I threw the carton in the trash and went for Haagen Daz, which satisfied my craving. I will never purchase Breyer’s again. In the age of organic and natural Breyer’s is a major fail."
Breyers,1,Terrible,Bring back Coffee Ice Cream. This Frozen dairy dessert is not fit for my dog. I loved your coffee ice cream. it was perfect but I cant stand this poor replacement. Yuck.
Breyers,1,Worst Coffee Ice Cream Ever,"This is by far the worst tasting coffee flavored ice cream I've ever had. I love dark roast coffee and drink primarily Colombian roast daily. I expected a coffee taste but also expected it to be sweet after all it is ice cream. But this ""ice cream"" I leaves a burnt coffee after taste in my mouth. Why did you make this coffee ice cream so incredibly bitter? This is not ice cream."
Breyers,1,Breyers Coffee Ice Cream is no longer worth eating,"I hadn't treated myself to ice cream recently, but bought some today and looked forward to enjoying it. I was sadly disappointed to find this product is nothing like the product I previously loved. Breyers Coffee flavored ice cream used to be my favorite, but that ended today. The product is light and fluffy, full of air, and not the creamy rich delicious flavorful product it used to be. This is a poor substitute for ice cream, and the last time I will ever purchase Breyers. BTW, this is an honest review, and I am not looking for any coupons for free product - I won't be taking any of this home again even if it is free. If you've pleased other customers with this change, well then good, but you've lost at least one customer."
Breyers,1,Not very good,"I am a new coffee flavored ice cream eater. I like it so much that it has almost replaced my old stand by which is chocolate. I recent became addicted to 2 of your competitors coffee ice cream but as it is not on sale at the moment I opted to try Breyers thinking it would be just as good. NOPE! I was so wrong. This has no coffee flavor at all. Texture wise it's fine but it really needs more flavor. Also it is not ice cream, It's frozen dairy dessert. That is my fault for not reading the label well. I will try to finish what I purchased but I won't buy another quart sadly."
Breyers,1,Not ice cream.,"Very little taste. Not ice cream. but frozen dairy dessert. Very little taste. I used to trust Breyers but this is not even close to ice cream. Leaves an after taste and I will not buy your ""frozen dairy dessert"" again."
Breyers,1,Hate the new coffee,"They changed the taste of the coffee ice cream, made the coffee taste stronger. Its awful. This was my comfort food, luckily I found a new source."
Breyers,1,Would never buy again,I have gotten Breyers coffee ice cream in the past and I don’t remember it tasting this bad. I thought I may have had an expired container but no. This tastes like instant coffee ice cream. I couldn’t eat it and threw out the rest which is something I never have done with any ice cream. By far the worst. I’m very surprised since breyers typical had good tasting ice cream. Maybe the workers where sleeping when they made this batch.
Breyers,1,not much flavor as expected,bought this at BJ’s thought it sounded good. very disappointed and waste of money. flavor is terrible and we drink columbian coffee.
Breyers,1,No cream in my ice cream,"I am horrified to recently learn that despite being packaged the same not all of your flavors are “ice cream”. I guess kudos to your Marketing team bc I thought every time I bought your “ice cream” I was feeding my family a good ice cream. Sadly, cream isn’t even on the ingredient list and you use skim milk. It’s no wonder you have to add corn syrup, sugar and fructose. ALL of your products will stay at the store rather than come home to my family from now on. I only wish I had known sooner."
Breyers,1,"Coffee ""FROZEN DAIRY DESSERT"" >>NOT<< ""Ice Cream""","Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky !!! Putting ""frozen dairy dessert"" in a container that looks just like an ""original ice cream"" container."
Breyers,1,Awful.,"When I purchase Brewers, I’ve learned to choose the most basic flavors (vanilla or chocolate) because all of the others are filled with junk. I thought I was safe picking a plain coffee flavor. The moment I tasted it, I knew something was off. It has an unnatural texture and the new “deep Colombian” flavor is bitter. I looked more closely at the package and found that this is not ice cream, it’s “frozen dairy dessert”. I wish I could get my money back."
Breyers,1,Recipe Change Lost Another Customer,"I grew up eating Bryers coffee ice cream since it was one of the only all-natural brands on the market with impeccable quality. Unfortunately, their recipe change to include completely unnatural ingredients ruined the product. I’ve switched to Whole Foods 365 brand since Breyers has destroyed my loyalty and trust. Must be trying to increase their margins at consumer expense."
Breyers,1,High Fructose Corn Syrup!,"Is the second ingredient. Unlike many of their ice creams, this is a frozen dessert and so stated on the package. After I read the ingredients, I realized it doesn’t say ice cream any where. I love Breyers but not this flavor."
Breyers,1,Changed for the worse,I used to consider that your Coffee ice cream was the best I had ever tried. Your new formulation is grossly inferior. Please bring the old formulation back !
Breyers,1,Disappointed,"I grew up eating Breyers Coffee ice cream at my Grandmother's house. We used to dip pretzel sticks in it. I just bought a gallon at the store because I hadn't had it in awhile, and it tasted nothing like I remember it. I was disappointed because it is one of the more expensive ice cream brands, and I couldn't even eat it because I really didn't like the taste. I assume you changed the recipe, but why change a good thing?"
Breyers,1,Changed recipe for the worse,"I used to LOVE Breyers coffee ice cream- it was smooth, creamy, bold and delicious. Unfortunately, now they've added something that makes it GUMMY and STICKY in the mouth- you already know you're eating something that doesn't belong in ice cream. It's a shame that they've done this thinking of increasing profits but actually ruining the brand and reputation of something that was good. No more Breyers for me or my family."
Breyers,1,Awful,What happened to the old ICE CREAM. not a frozen dairy dessert. Its all foamy and soft. I want the old Bryers back. It use to be my favorite but now I will throw it all away and buy a diffrent brand.
Breyers,1,Terrible Coffee,"Use to love your coffee ice cream. Today I was going to have some, thinking how yummy it WAS. It is terrible. Nasty. Been hours since I tried it and still have a nasty taste in my mouth. I have never tasted an ice cream so terrible. It use to be my favorite ice cream. I agree with the other negative reviews. Trash it. Leave a great product alone."
Breyers,1,Awful!,"Breyers coffee ice cream has been my favorite for close to 50 years - not anymore! Bring back the old recipe with real ingredients. Until then, I’ll find another brand."
Breyers,1,Disappoints,This new dairy dessert is not up to your usual breyers standards.very disappointed with texture and taste. will not buy again ..have been a lifetime breyers ice cream buyer but with all the new additives you are now no different than any other ice cream brand.i will no longer purchase Breyers or recommend it.
Breyers,1,Disappointed,This was one of my favorite ice cream flavors and one of the few remaining Breyers ‘ice cream’ options instead of ‘frozen dairy dessert’. I have always loved Brewers because of the simple pure ingredients. Disappointed to see Breyer’s is headed a different direction and adding corn syrup and other ingredients to their ice cream and my options for Breyer’s ice cream is decreasing.
Breyers,1,Not Ice cream,Dairy desert Junk PLEASE LABEL NOT REAL ICE CREAM buying for 65 years good by
Breyers,1,"Terrible, never again",I used to enjoy Breyer ice cream with coffee and natural vanilla as my go to flavors. I was disgusted by the consistency and overly sweet flavor of this new version. I will never by this product again. It doesn’t even resemble ice cream anymore. I should have read the label on this more closely. Into the garbage bin I’m afraid. Buyer beware.
Breyers,1,Disappointing!,"I grew up on Breyer’s coffee ice cream, it was my favorite. This new “ice cream” recipe is terrible. It doesn’t taste anything like it used to. Not worth buying again. I still like their natural vanilla but I’ll have to go elsewhere for coffee flavor. Bring back the original recipe!!"
Breyers,1,Frozen Dairy Dessert?!,"Breyers, please bring back ice cream. Your coffee ice cream was amazing. This frozen dairy dessert is all kinds of wrong. The texture, the taste, the ingredients. What has happened? Completely disappointed. I will certainly not purchase again."
Breyers,1,Doesn't Taste Good,"At first I thought something was wrong with My Tastebuds. Dear Breyers, this one was a Mistake.
Your truly,
X-Coffeee Icecream lover."
Breyers,1,NOT ICE CREAM its frozen dairy junk,Scam put the words FROZEN DAIRY BIG not small one taste I new
Breyers,1,Missed the flavor,"Missed the flavor of s’more. No marshmallow flavor, chocolate very light- the graham crumb bites were good, overall very disappointed as this was really a splurge"
Breyers,1,Disappointing,S’mores flavored is cream is one of my favorites. Brewers usually has great quality and therefore yummy ice cream so I was excited to see this flavor in the store. This version is very disappointing. The marshmallows are really gross-weird textures-almost like stale hard mini marshmallows you threw in your ice cream. The Graham was almost non existent but that’s ok since it also was off in texture and flavor. Try again Brewers but maybe go for a marshmallow cream swirl and chocolate covered Graham cracker pieces.
Breyers,1,It doesnt taste like s'mores at all.,I was really looking forward to this ice cream but its actually gross. It tastes like really strong cinnamon and cardboard. :(
Breyers,1,horrible,"I love ice cream and saw this at the store so I figured I would try S'mores along with the Peach cobbler. I tried the S'mores first, along with my family, and it was awful. taste nothing like S'mores. The graham cracker was grainy, marshmallows tasted like vanilla frosting. Will NOT buy again."
Breyers,1,No good unfortunately,Marshmallows are chalky while the graham cracker piece does leave a lot to be desired. Please try again I would gladly give it another try when the contents are changed.
Breyers,1,Such a disappointment!,"I usually love anything and everything s'mores so I was excited to try this new flavor!! Although, after 1/2 a bite, I was disgusted!! The vanilla and graham cracker part tasted like coconut and cinnamon. (Ingredients list oatmeal and ""spices"" in this part.) The chocolate part with ""marshmallow flavored pieces,"" tasted awful!! It would have been so much better with actual marshmallows (or even marshmallow creme)! This tastes nothing like s'mores and I'm saddened they're giving people the wrong impression of such a delicious treat!"
Breyers,1,Yuck,This is so bad we may just throw it out... can't say anything good about it..didn't taste like s'mores.. chocolate barely chocolatey. who knows what the middle flavor was.. this was nasty Very disappointed.. Breyers usually has good flavors.. this will go in the trash.. not worth the calories..
Breyers,1,No graham cracker,This ice cream is not even close to a s’more. Way too much little tiny chewy marshmallow pieces and no crunch graham crackers. The marshmallows have an odd taste. They could have done so much better with a classic summer desert. Really bad!
Breyers,1,IS NOT GOOD,"THIS REVIEW DOES NOT VIOLATE GUIDELINES. The ice cream does not taste good. Wouldnt reccomend to anybody.
Calling to complain about how reviews are ""moderated"" if they are negative. That is bias and not true to this being a fair review. Not ever buying breyers again, and spreading the word about the company misconduct."
Breyers,1,Sorry I tried it. Won't buy this again!,I am disappointed with the S'mores ice cream. The chocolate ice cream should have a stronger chocolate flavor. The graham crackers in the white ice cream (What flavor is the white ice cream suppose to be?) had a funny tastes to them. I recommend you cover the graham cracker pieces in chocolate and make the white ice cream a strong vanilla flavor. I won't buy this flavor again.
Breyers,1,Weird flavors,"We were so excited to try the S’mores ice cream. Ugh! Super disappointed! We thought the marshmallows were actually soggy, cinnamon-flavored graham cracker pieces. I had to spit them out to decipher what they were. This ice cream doesn’t taste like S’mores AT ALL."
Breyers,1,Disappointing,Sounded good but it wasn’t. Nothing like a S’more. The ice cream isn’t creamy. I tasted coconut but didn’t notice it in the ingredients. The marshmallows are a very odd texture and taste. What graham cracker? This isn’t Breyer’s standards.
Breyers,1,Just Bad,"doesn't even taste like s'mores. really heavy on the spices that have that licorice taste (star anise, fennel, cardamom, etc.) so much so that it reminds me of 5 Chinese spice blends."
Breyers,1,Not what I expected,"Not a fan. After having a coupon, I was excited to try this. My husband and I don’t think it measures up to Brewers standards. Don’t like the marshmallows at all."
Breyers,1,Skip,"Doesn’t taste like ice cream or s’mores. My comment to the R&D department would be, “you stopped and were satisfied with this for production? Really?!? This?”"
Breyers,1,Awful,I was looking forward to this flavor but all I tasted was cinnamon. Gross!! You need to get a new recipe and leave out the cinnamon!
Breyers,1,Terrible taste - not how it used to be,I have loved this flavor before but something is different this year and it doesn’t taste good at all. Super disappointing!
Breyers,1,Just don't buy it,Usually anything smores flavor I love. This absolutely terrible and for the price you pay
Breyers,1,Surprised,Brownie Cheesecake is terrible. I’m surprised. It’s just 2/3 chocolate ice cream with 1/3 weird cheesecake ice cream. There are no chunks of brownie or cheesecake at all. Certainly not like the picture on the box at all.
Breyers,1,Does not taste like brownies or cheesecake.,"This is a disappointment to me from Breyer's. None of the ice cream in this concoction has flavor. The pieces put in both the chocolate and cheesecake parts do not taste good at all. I can't even describe it. Breyer's needs to pull this one and work on it some more. Not up to par with the quality of their other flavors, for example chocolate truffle. The Cinnabon ice cream itself is delicious, however the ""bun"" pieces in it leaves a little to be desired. Both carbsmart ice creams are delicious, and so on. The Brownie Cheesecake is the first that I have not cared for because of the lack of proper flavoring."
Breyers,1,The worst flavor,"This was a waste of money. My mom bought this flavor to surprise me on my period and It’s bland, boring and honestly? A waste of calories. Do better breyers. Do better."
Breyers,1,Mistake in production chocolate isn’t chocolate,This would have been amazing but the chocolate ice cream tastes and looks nothing like chocolate. It tasted awful. There must be a production mistake because it doesn’t even look like the picture. I would upload a picture but it won’t load. Essentially it looks like vanilla with a tint of beige
Breyers,1,Terrible flavor,Cheesecake and brownies are my two favorite desserts. I was over the moon to see this in the store and to be able to get it as a birthday treat for myself. It was so terrible and disappointing. The ice cream tasted very watered down while the brownie and cheesecake pieces all we’re very bland. It was a serious let down.
Breyers,1,Blan,"It sounds like a great idea for an ice cream, but it was not pulled off. The cheesecake part had a little flavor, but the two chocolate sides had absolutly none. Waste of $5, going in the trash."
Breyers,1,Flavorless,I was really looking forward to ice cream unfortunately this did not do it for me. It had very little flavor at least the cone was good. P.S. My husband couldn't taste it either.
Breyers,1,,It wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I was really disappointed. The cheesecake part taste really gross. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone
Breyers,1,very disappointed,I gave never been this disappointed in an ice cream flavor. Definetly not worth the 6 bucks I paid for it.
Breyers,1,Terrible missing the chocolate ice cream,"There was no chocolate ice cream in this at all, this was very very disappointing, didn’t even come close to looking like the package"
Breyers,1,Terrible,This ice cream has no flavor at all. No one in the entire family liked it. Kids refusing ice cream - for real?
